## Final Root Directory Structure

The root directory now contains only:

- Configuration files (Makefile, pyproject.toml, requirements\*.txt, codecov.yml, go.mod, go.sum)
- Essential documentation (README.md, TODO.md, ISSUES_TO_TACKLE.md)
- Build artifacts (mcp-mesh-dev, mcp-mesh-registry)
- Utility scripts (clean_start.sh)
- Source directories (src/, cmd/, tests/, examples/, docs/, scripts/)
- Project planning (project-plan/)
- Build/dist directories

The project now has a clean, professional structure suitable for public release.
