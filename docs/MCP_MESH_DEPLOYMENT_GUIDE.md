## 🔧 General Troubleshooting

### Quick Diagnostic Check

```bash
# Run system diagnostic
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mcp-mesh/mcp-mesh/main/scripts/diagnose.sh | bash

# Or download and run locally
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mcp-mesh/mcp-mesh/main/scripts/diagnose.sh
chmod +x diagnose.sh
./diagnose.sh
```

### Common Issues Across All Deployments

1. **Network connectivity** - Agents can't reach registry
2. **Version mismatches** - Inconsistent MCP Mesh versions
3. **Resource limits** - Insufficient CPU/memory
4. **DNS resolution** - Service discovery failures
5. **TLS/SSL issues** - Certificate validation errors

Each section includes specific troubleshooting guides. For general issues, see our [Master Troubleshooting Guide](./deployment-guide/troubleshooting-master.md).

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

### Current Limitations (v1.x)

- **Multi-region**: Limited support for geo-distributed deployments
- **Languages**: Full support only for Python agents (Go agents experimental)
- **Protocols**: HTTP/WebSocket only (gRPC planned)
- **Security**: Basic authentication (OAuth2/OIDC in roadmap)
- **Scale**: Tested up to 1000 agents per registry
- **Platforms**: Full support for Linux/macOS (Windows via WSL2)

### Planned Improvements

- Multi-region registry federation
- Additional language SDKs (JavaScript, Rust)
- Advanced security features (mTLS, RBAC)
- Horizontal registry scaling
- Native Windows support
