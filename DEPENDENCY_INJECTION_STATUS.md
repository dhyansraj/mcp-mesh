# Dependency Injection Implementation Status

## What We've Implemented

1. **Dynamic Dependency Injector** (`runtime/dependency_injector.py`)

   - Tracks available dependencies
   - Creates wrapper functions with injection
   - Handles topology changes (register/unregister)
   - Supports both sync and async functions
   - Uses weak references for cleanup

2. **Updated mesh_agent Decorator**

   - Now creates a wrapper when dependencies are specified
   - Wrapper handles injection at call time
   - Preserves all metadata

3. **Comprehensive Unit Tests**
   - Test static injection
   - Test dynamic updates
   - Test concurrent changes
   - Test memory cleanup

## The Problem

FastMCP appears to store its own internal wrapper of functions, not the actual function object we provide. This means:

1. When we do `@mesh_agent()` then `@server.tool()`, FastMCP gets our wrapper
2. But it stores something else internally (possibly its own wrapper)
3. Our injection wrapper never gets called through MCP protocol

## Evidence

```python
# After decoration:
test_func: <function test_func at 0xe0720bfaad40>  # Our wrapper
Has _update_dependency: True

# What FastMCP stored:
Stored function: <function test_func at 0xe0720bfaaca0>  # Different object!
Has _update_dependency: False
```

## Possible Solutions

1. **Hook into FastMCP's execution path**

   - Find where FastMCP actually calls functions
   - Inject our logic there
   - May require monkey-patching

2. **Use FastMCP's extension points**

   - Check if FastMCP has middleware or interceptor support
   - Register our injection logic there

3. **Runtime modification**

   - After server.tool() is applied, modify what's stored
   - Replace FastMCP's stored function with our wrapper

4. **Different approach**
   - Instead of wrapping functions, use a proxy pattern
   - Intercept at the MCP protocol level

## What Works Now

- Direct function calls get proper injection
- The injection system handles topology changes correctly
- The architecture is sound

## What Doesn't Work

- Injection through MCP protocol (via MCP Inspector)
- This is because FastMCP doesn't call our wrapper

## Next Steps

1. Investigate FastMCP's internals more deeply
2. Find the right hook point for injection
3. Consider alternative approaches if needed

The dependency injection system is fully implemented and tested. The only remaining issue is integration with FastMCP's function execution path.
