# AC-4 Health Monitoring and Lifecycle Verification Results

## Overview

This document provides verification results for Acceptance Criteria 4 (AC-4) Health Monitoring and Lifecycle Management features.

## AC-4.1: Timer-based Health Monitoring ✅ VERIFIED

**Status:** ✅ FULLY OPERATIONAL

### Features Verified:

- ✅ Timer-based health tracking
- ✅ Configurable timeout thresholds per agent type
- ✅ Automatic status transitions (healthy → degraded → expired)
- ✅ Passive health monitoring (no active checks)
- ✅ Health status API endpoints
- ✅ Registry metrics collection
- ✅ Prometheus metrics export
- ✅ Agent revival with heartbeat

### Test Evidence:

```
🧪 Testing Timer-Based Health Monitoring System
============================================================

1️⃣ Registering test agents...
   ✓ Registered test-agent-1 (type: test-agent, timeout: 3s, eviction: 6s)
   ✓ Registered critical-agent-1 (type: critical-agent, timeout: 2s, eviction: 4s)
   ✓ Registered default-agent-1 (type: default, timeout: 5s, eviction: 10s)

[...status transitions verified...]

✅ Timer-based health monitoring test completed!
```

## AC-4.2: Agent Lifecycle Management ✅ VERIFIED

**Status:** ✅ FULLY OPERATIONAL

### AC-4.2.1: Agent Registration and Heartbeat Establishes Healthy Status ✅

**Verification:** Agents start with "pending" status and transition to "healthy" after first heartbeat.

```
📝 AC-4.2.1: Testing agent registration establishes initial healthy status
------------------------------------------------------------
   ✓ Registered test-agent-1: ID=9d72d7c6-0538-4966-98be-7d1daa1d1fc7
     - Status: pending
     - Timeout threshold: 2s
     - Eviction threshold: 4s
     - Initial heartbeat: ✓
     - Status after heartbeat: healthy
     - Health status: healthy
     - Last heartbeat: 0.0s ago
   🎯 AC-4.2.1 VERIFIED: Agent registration and heartbeat establishes healthy status
```

### AC-4.2.2: Graceful Shutdown Removes Agents from Active Registry ✅

**Verification:** Agents properly unregister and are removed from the registry during graceful shutdown.

```
🛑 AC-4.2.2: Testing graceful shutdown removes agents from active registry
------------------------------------------------------------
   📤 Gracefully shutting down test-agent-1...
   Shutdown result: ✓
   ✓ Agent test-agent-1 successfully removed from registry
   ✓ Agent critical-agent-1 still in registry
   ✓ Agent regular-agent-1 still in registry
   🎯 AC-4.2.2 VERIFIED: Graceful shutdown removes agents from active registry
```

### AC-4.2.3: Crash Detection Identifies Unresponsive Agents ✅

**Verification:** System properly detects crashed agents through missing heartbeats and transitions their status.

```
💥 AC-4.2.3: Testing crash detection identifies unresponsive agents
------------------------------------------------------------
   💥 Simulating crash of critical-agent-1 (stopping heartbeats)...
   ⏰ Waiting for timeout threshold to pass (1.5 seconds)...
   💥 Crashed agent critical-agent-1: degraded - Agent degraded - no heartbeat for 1.5s
   💚 Healthy agent regular-agent-1: healthy - Agent healthy - last heartbeat 0.0s ago
   ⏰ Waiting for eviction threshold to pass (1 more second)...
   💀 Crashed agent critical-agent-1: expired - Agent expired - no heartbeat for 2.6s
   🎯 AC-4.2.3 VERIFIED: Crash detection identifies unresponsive agents
```

### AC-4.2.4: Recovery Process Handles Agent Restarts Correctly ✅

**Verification:** Agents can restart and re-register, returning to healthy status after heartbeat.

```
🔄 AC-4.2.4: Testing recovery process handles agent restarts correctly
------------------------------------------------------------
   🔄 Starting recovery agent test-agent-1-recovered...
   ✓ Recovery agent registered: ID=79d68870-bf2b-42e8-9d01-15d4a2ca3093, Status=pending
   💓 Recovery heartbeat: ✓
   💚 Recovery agent health: healthy - Agent healthy - last heartbeat 0.0s ago
   🔄 Re-registering original crashed agent critical-agent-1...
   ✓ Re-registered agent: Status=expired
   💓 Revival heartbeat: ✓
   💚 Revived agent health: healthy - Agent healthy - last heartbeat 0.0s ago
   🎯 AC-4.2.4 VERIFIED: Recovery process handles agent restarts correctly
```

## Health State Transitions

The system properly implements the following state transitions:

```
pending → healthy (after first heartbeat)
healthy → degraded (after timeout threshold)
degraded → expired (after eviction threshold)
expired → healthy (after new heartbeat)
```

## Registry Metrics

Final registry metrics show proper tracking:

```
📊 Final Registry State Verification
----------------------------------------
   📈 Total agents: 12
   💚 Healthy agents: 3
   🟡 Degraded agents: 0
   🔴 Expired agents: 5
   🔄 Heartbeats processed: 8
   📦 Total capabilities: 15
```

## Conclusion

✅ **AC-4 HEALTH MONITORING AND LIFECYCLE CRITERIA FULLY VERIFIED**

All health monitoring and lifecycle management features are working correctly:

1. ✅ **AC-4.1:** Timer-based health monitoring operates correctly
2. ✅ **AC-4.2.1:** Agent registration and heartbeat establishes healthy status
3. ✅ **AC-4.2.2:** Graceful shutdown removes agents from active registry
4. ✅ **AC-4.2.3:** Crash detection identifies unresponsive agents
