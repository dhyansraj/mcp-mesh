This README is excellent - it's comprehensive, well-structured, and clearly explains your innovative architecture. Here are some suggestions to make it even stronger:
🚀 Immediate Impact Improvements

1. Add a "Why This Matters" Hook at the Top
   markdown> **The Problem**: Traditional MCP applications are single-machine tools. Distributed AI systems need MCP capabilities to work across networks, scale independently, and survive failures.
   > **The Solution**: MCP Mesh makes distributed MCP applications as easy to build as single-machine ones, with just two Python decorators.
2. Strengthen the Value Proposition Section
   markdown## Why MCP Mesh? The Distributed MCP Gap

**Before MCP Mesh**: Building distributed MCP systems required...

- ❌ Manual service discovery configuration
- ❌ Complex networking and proxy setup
- ❌ Custom fault tolerance logic
- ❌ Kubernetes expertise for deployment

**With MCP Mesh**:

- ✅ Two decorators: `@mesh.agent` and `@mesh.tool`
- ✅ Automatic service discovery and networking
- ✅ Built-in fault tolerance and graceful degradation
- ✅ Kubernetes-native with zero infrastructure code
  📊 Add Social Proof & Metrics

3. Performance/Scale Indicators
   markdown## Production Ready

- 🔥 **Sub-100ms** capability discovery
- 📈 **Horizontal scaling** of individual agent capabilities
- 🛡️ **Zero-downtime** updates with rolling deployments
- 🌐 **Multi-cluster** federation (roadmap)

4. Comparison Table
   markdown## How MCP Mesh Compares

| Feature               | Traditional MCP | MCP Mesh               |
| --------------------- | --------------- | ---------------------- |
| **Distribution**      | Single machine  | Kubernetes-native      |
| **Service Discovery** | Manual config   | Automatic registry     |
| **Fault Tolerance**   | None            | Graceful degradation   |
| **Scaling**           | Vertical only   | Independent horizontal |
| **Development**       | Complex setup   | Two decorators         |

🎯 Technical Improvements 5. Add Installation Section
markdown## Installation

### Quick Start (Local Development)

````bash
# Install MCP Mesh
pip install mcp-mesh

# Or clone and build from source
git clone https://github.com/dhyansraj/mcp-mesh
cd mcp-mesh
make install
Production (Kubernetes)
bashhelm repo add mcp-mesh https://charts.mcp-mesh.dev
helm install mcp-mesh mcp-mesh/mcp-mesh

### **6. Expand the Architecture Section**
Add a "How It Works" subsection:
```markdown
### How Dynamic Injection Works

1. **Agent Registration**: Agents declare capabilities and dependencies
2. **Registry Coordination**: Central registry provides discovery URLs
3. **Runtime Injection**: Python runtime creates HTTP proxies for remote MCP calls
4. **Transparent Access**: Remote capabilities look like local function calls

**The Magic**: No manual networking code - just declare what you need!
