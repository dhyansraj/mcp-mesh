FROM mcp-mesh-base:latest

# This Dockerfile extends the base image for specific agent deployments
# The base image already has mcp_mesh installed and configured

# Copy agent script (to be overridden in docker-compose or at runtime)
COPY examples/simple/hello_world.py /app/agent.py

# Expose the standard agent port
EXPOSE 8080

# Health check using python requests (already available in base)
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=3s --start-period=5s --retries=3 \
    CMD python -c "import requests; requests.get('http://localhost:8080/health', timeout=5)" || exit 1

# Run the agent by default
