## Notes

- Items marked with üö® are production blockers that must be resolved before any production deployment
- Each checkbox item should become a GitHub issue with appropriate labels
- Sub-items can be converted to tasks within each issue
- Priority levels are based on production readiness requirements and user impact
- This list should be reviewed and updated weekly based on progress and new findings
