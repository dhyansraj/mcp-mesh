**Goal: Comprehensive deployment guide and tooling for MCP Mesh across all environments from development to production**

# Week 3, Day 1: Multi-Environment Deployment Infrastructure

## Primary Objectives

- Enable seamless deployment across development, staging, and production environments
- Support multiple deployment modes: local development, Docker Compose, Kubernetes (vanilla, Helm, managed)
- Create umbrella Helm chart for platform services (registry, database, ingress, monitoring)
- Establish deployment patterns for major cloud providers (EKS, AKS, GKE)
- Provide clear migration path from development to production

## Strategic Value Proposition

**"Deploy Anywhere, Scale Everywhere"**

- **Development First**: Zero-friction local development experience
- **Progressive Complexity**: Natural progression from docker-compose to Kubernetes
- **Cloud Native**: First-class support for major cloud providers
- **Production Ready**: Enterprise-grade deployment patterns with monitoring and security
- **Community Friendly**: Easy evaluation path for open source users

## Deployment Modes Requirements

### 1. Local Development Mode (No Containers)

**Purpose**: Rapid development and debugging without container overhead

- Pure Python execution with virtual environments
- Local file-based registry (SQLite)
- Process management via existing CLI tool
- Hot-reload support for agent development
- IDE debugging compatibility
- Minimal system requirements

### 2. Docker Compose Mode

**Purpose**: Multi-service development with isolated environments

- Complete MCP Mesh stack in docker-compose.yml
- Development and production variants
- Volume mounts for hot-reload during development
- Pre-configured networking between services
- Built-in observability stack (Prometheus, Grafana)
- Database options (SQLite for dev, PostgreSQL for prod-like)

### 3. Vanilla Kubernetes Mode

**Purpose**: Standard Kubernetes deployment without Helm

- Kustomize-based deployment (building on existing k8s/ directory)
- Environment overlays (dev, staging, prod)
- Manual secret management
- Basic ingress configuration
- Prometheus ServiceMonitor integration
- PVC templates for persistence

### 4. Helm Mode

**Purpose**: Production-grade deployment with full customization

- Umbrella chart for complete platform deployment
- Individual charts for registry and agents
- Dependency management between charts
- Values files for different environments
- Automated ingress configuration
- External database support
- Monitoring and alerting setup

### 5. Managed Kubernetes Platforms

**Purpose**: Cloud-native deployments leveraging platform services

- **EKS (AWS)**:

  - IAM integration for pod security
  - EBS storage class configuration
  - ALB ingress controller setup
  - CloudWatch integration option

- **AKS (Azure)**:

  - Azure AD integration
  - Azure disk storage classes
  - Application Gateway ingress
  - Azure Monitor integration

- **GKE (Google Cloud)**:
  - Workload Identity setup
  - GCE persistent disk configuration
  - Google Cloud Load Balancer
  - Cloud Monitoring integration

## Technical Requirements

### Infrastructure Components

- **Local Docker Registry**: Setup and configuration for development
- **External Registry Support**: DockerHub, ECR, ACR, GCR integration
- **Database Options**: SQLite (dev), PostgreSQL/MySQL (prod)
- **Ingress Controllers**: Nginx, Traefik, cloud-specific options
- **Certificate Management**: cert-manager integration
- **Monitoring Stack**: Prometheus, Grafana, AlertManager

### Helm Chart Architecture

- **Umbrella Chart** (`helm/mcp-mesh-platform/`):

  - Deploys complete MCP Mesh platform
  - Manages dependencies between services
  - Configurable component selection
  - Environment-specific values

- **Enhanced Agent Chart**:
  - Dynamic ingress path registration
  - Multi-agent deployment support
  - Configurable resource limits
  - Sidecar container support

### Development Experience

- **Quick Start Scripts**: One-command setup for each environment
- **Environment Templates**: Pre-configured .env files
- **Troubleshooting Guides**: Common issues and solutions
- **Performance Tuning**: Recommendations for different scales

## Success Criteria

- Developer can go from zero to running MCP Mesh in under 5 minutes
- Seamless progression from development to production deployment
- Cloud-agnostic deployment patterns with cloud-specific optimizations
- Complete observability across all deployment modes
- Security best practices implemented by default
- Cost-effective resource utilization patterns documented

## Deliverables

1. Comprehensive deployment documentation
2. Docker Compose configurations for development and production
3. Enhanced Kubernetes manifests with environment overlays
4. Production-ready Helm charts with extensive customization
5. Cloud-specific deployment guides and scripts
6. Quick start scripts for each deployment mode
7. Troubleshooting and operations guide
8. Performance tuning recommendations

## Dependencies on Existing Work

- Leverage existing Kubernetes manifests and Helm charts
- Build upon current CLI tool for local development
- Extend existing Docker configurations
- Maintain compatibility with current deployment patterns

## Open Questions for Discussion

1. Should we support additional deployment modes (systemd, cloud functions)?
2. What level of monitoring/observability should be included by default?
3. How do we handle secrets management across different environments?
4. Should we provide terraform/pulumi modules for cloud infrastructure?
5. What's the minimum viable deployment for evaluation purposes?
6. How do we handle data migration between deployment modes?
7. Should we include service mesh (Istio/Linkerd) configurations?
