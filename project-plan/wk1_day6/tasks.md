# Week 1, Day 5: Interface-Optional Dependency Injection - Tasks

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT INSTRUCTION: PARTIAL IMPLEMENTATION EXISTS

**CRITICAL**: Dependency injection infrastructure has been partially implemented. Before modifying any existing code:

1. **Analyze existing implementation** in:
   - `src/runtime/python/src/mcp_mesh/runtime/dependency_injector.py` - Core injector exists
   - `src/runtime/python/src/mcp_mesh/runtime/processor.py` - Has TODO in `_setup_dependency_injection`
   - `src/runtime/python/src/mcp_mesh/runtime/tools/proxy_factory.py` - Proxy creation exists
   - `src/runtime/python/src/mcp_mesh/decorators.py` - Creates injection wrapper
2. **Understand the gap**: The pieces exist but aren't connected. The processor doesn't query registry for dependencies or create proxies.
3. **Follow the new design**: Registry returns resolved dependencies in registration/heartbeat responses.

## Pre-Implementation Phase (1 hour)

### Dependency Verification (CRITICAL)

**üîç MUST VERIFY: Week 1, Day 4 completion before starting!**

- [ ] Verify enhanced registry database schema is operational
- [ ] Confirm semantic capability matching works with @mesh_agent metadata
- [ ] Validate agent versioning system integration
- [ ] Test package separation (mcp-mesh-types vs mcp-mesh) functionality
- [ ] Document any gaps that need addressing before proceeding

## Phase 1: Core Auto-Discovery Foundation (4 hours)

### Enhanced Method Signature Extraction

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Extends @mesh_agent decorator from Week 1, Day 4!**

- [ ] **Package Placement**: Signature types in mcp-mesh-types, extraction logic in mcp-mesh
- [ ] Implement MethodMetadata class for storing extracted signatures:
  ```python
  class MethodMetadata:
      method_name: str
      signature: inspect.Signature
      capabilities: List[str]
      return_type: Type
      parameters: Dict[str, Type]
      type_hints: Dict[str, Type]
  ```
- [ ] Enhance @mesh_agent decorator to extract method signatures automatically
- [ ] Store method metadata on decorated functions for registry discovery
- [ ] Integrate with existing capability registration from Week 1, Day 4

### Registry Schema Enhancement for Service Contracts

**üì¶ Package Placement**: Contract types in mcp-mesh-types, storage logic in mcp-mesh

- [ ] Extend registry database schema to store service contracts:
  - Service method signatures and return types
  - Parameter validation rules and type information
  - Capability-to-method mapping for discovery
  - Version compatibility information for contract evolution
- [ ] Implement ServiceContract storage and retrieval operations
- [ ] Add contract validation to ensure signature consistency
- [ ] Create registry tools for contract management:
  - store_service_contract(class_type: Type, metadata: MethodMetadata) -> ContractResult
  - get_service_contract(class_type: Type) -> ServiceContract
  - validate_contract_compatibility(contract: ServiceContract) -> ValidationResult

## Phase 2: Dynamic Proxy Generation (5 hours)

### Base Proxy Infrastructure

**üì¶ Package Placement**: Proxy interfaces in mcp-mesh-types, generation logic in mcp-mesh

- [ ] Implement MeshServiceProxy base class:
  ```python
  class MeshServiceProxy:
      def __init__(self, service_class: Type, registry_client: RegistryClient, endpoint: str)
      def _generate_proxy_methods(self) -> None
      def _create_proxy_method(self, method_name: str, metadata: MethodMetadata) -> Callable
  ```
- [ ] Create proxy method generation using service contracts from registry
- [ ] Implement remote method call translation through MCP protocol
- [ ] Add error handling and retry logic for remote calls

### Dynamic Class Generation

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Must maintain type safety for IDE support!**

- [ ] Implement dynamic proxy class creation matching concrete class interfaces
- [ ] Preserve type annotations and method signatures in generated proxies
- [ ] Add runtime type checking for method parameters and return values
- [ ] Create proxy factory for generating service proxies:
  - create_service_proxy(service_class: Type) -> ServiceProxy
  - resolve_service_endpoint(service_class: Type) -> EndpointInfo
  - validate_proxy_compatibility(proxy: ServiceProxy, contract: ServiceContract) -> bool

### Registry Integration for Service Discovery

**üîó DEPENDENCIES: Requires enhanced registry from Week 1, Day 4**
**üìù NEW DESIGN**: Registry returns resolved dependencies in registration/heartbeat responses

- [ ] **Registry Side Changes**:
  - Modify registration response to include `dependencies_resolved` field
  - Modify heartbeat response to include `dependencies_resolved` field
  - Implement dependency resolution logic: for each requested dependency, find first healthy agent with that capability
  - Return null for dependencies with no healthy providers
  - Response structure:
    ```json
    {
      "status": "success",
      "agent_id": "hello_world_1234",
      "dependencies_resolved": {
        "SystemAgent": {
          "agent_id": "sys_123",
          "endpoint": "stdio://localhost:8001",
          "status": "healthy"
        },
        "Logger": null // No healthy Logger available
      }
    }
    ```
- [ ] **Processor Side Changes**:
  - Store `_last_dependencies_resolved` to track dependency state
  - Compare new responses with stored state to detect changes
  - Only recreate proxies when dependencies actually change
  - Handle null dependencies gracefully (no proxy creation)

## Phase 3: Unified Dependency Injection (6 hours)

### Fallback Chain Implementation

**üîÑ CRITICAL: Seamless degradation from remote to local!**

- [ ] **Package Placement**: Fallback interfaces in mcp-mesh-types, logic in mcp-mesh
- [ ] Implement dependency resolution chain:
  1. Try remote proxy via registry discovery
  2. Fall back to local class instantiation
  3. Provide graceful error handling if both fail
- [ ] Add configuration for fallback behavior:
  ```python
  @mesh_agent(dependencies=[OAuth2AuthService], fallback_mode=True)
  async def secure_operation(auth: OAuth2AuthService):
      # Works with remote proxy OR local instance
  ```
- [ ] Create fallback monitoring and logging for operational visibility

### Unified Dependency Pattern Support

**üéØ GOAL: Support 3 patterns simultaneously without breaking existing code**

- [ ] **Package Placement**: Dependency types in mcp-mesh-types, resolution in mcp-mesh
- [ ] Implement unified dependency resolver supporting:
  - String dependencies: `"legacy_auth"` (existing from Week 1, Day 4)
  - Protocol interfaces: `AuthService` (traditional interface-based)
  - Concrete classes: `OAuth2AuthService` (new auto-discovery pattern)
- [ ] Add dependency injection at function call time:
  ```python
  @mesh_agent(dependencies=[
      "legacy_auth",           # String (existing)
      AuthService,             # Protocol interface
      OAuth2AuthService,       # Concrete class (new)
  ])
  async def flexible_function(
      legacy_auth: str,
      auth_service: AuthService,
      oauth2_auth: OAuth2AuthService
  ):
      # All three patterns work simultaneously!
  ```
- [ ] Create dependency validation and type checking

### Enhanced @mesh_agent Integration

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Must maintain backward compatibility with Week 1, Day 4!**
**üîß IMPLEMENTATION**: Complete the TODO in processor.py `_setup_dependency_injection`

- [ ] **Complete Processor Implementation**:
  - Replace TODO in `_setup_dependency_injection` with actual implementation
  - Process `dependencies_resolved` from registry response
  - For each resolved dependency:
    ```python
    # Create proxy using endpoint from registry
    proxy = create_service_proxy(dep_name, endpoint=dep_info["endpoint"])
    # Register with injector
    injector = get_global_injector()
    await injector.register_dependency(dep_name, proxy)
    ```
  - Store resolved dependencies state for comparison in heartbeat
- [ ] **Health Monitor Updates**:
  - In `_health_monitor` method, process heartbeat response
  - Compare `dependencies_resolved` with stored state
  - If changed, call `_update_dependency_proxies` to recreate proxies
  - Handle dependency removal (unregister from injector)
- [ ] **Edge Case Handling**:
  - Dependency not available (null in response) - skip proxy creation
  - Dependency becomes unavailable - unregister from injector
  - Dependency changes to different agent - recreate proxy
  - First-time registration vs late registration (retry scenario)

## Integration and Testing (2 hours)

### Comprehensive Integration Testing

**üì¶ Package Placement**: Test interfaces in mcp-mesh-types, test logic in mcp-mesh

- [ ] Create integration tests covering all dependency patterns
- [ ] Test fallback chain functionality (remote ‚Üí local ‚Üí error)
- [ ] Validate type safety and IDE support with generated proxies
- [ ] Ensure backward compatibility with existing Week 1, Day 4 functionality

### Documentation and Examples

**üìñ CRITICAL: All examples must import only from mcp-mesh-types!**

- [ ] Create comprehensive examples demonstrating:
  - Interface-optional dependency injection patterns
  - Fallback behavior in different environments
  - Migration from string dependencies to concrete classes
  - All three dependency patterns working together
- [ ] Document service contract auto-discovery process
- [ ] Provide troubleshooting guide for common integration issues

- [ ] Fallback chain degrades gracefully without runtime errors
- [ ] Type safety maintained for IDE support and development experience
- [ ] Backward compatibility with all Week 1, Day 4 features maintained

## Success Metrics

- [ ] Zero Protocol interface definitions required for dependency injection
- [ ] Service contracts auto-extracted from @mesh_agent decorated methods
- [ ] Dynamic proxies provide seamless remote service calls

- [ ] Fallback chain enables same code to work in mesh and standalone environments
- [ ] Full type safety and IDE support maintained throughout

## üìã Implementation Summary

### Current State

- **Dependency Injector**: ‚úÖ Exists and works (`dependency_injector.py`)
- **Proxy Factory**: ‚úÖ Exists and can create proxies (`proxy_factory.py`)
- **Decorator Wrapper**: ‚úÖ Creates injection wrapper (`decorators.py`)
- **Missing Link**: ‚ùå Processor doesn't resolve dependencies from registry

### New Architecture

1. **Registry Returns Dependencies**: Both registration and heartbeat responses include `dependencies_resolved`
2. **Simple Selection**: Registry returns first healthy agent per capability (phase 1)
3. **Processor Creates Proxies**: Using endpoints from registry response
4. **Efficient Updates**: Only recreate proxies when dependencies change

### Key Design Decisions

- **Passive Registry**: Never pushes to agents, only responds to requests
- **Lightweight Processor**: No complex matching logic, just proxy creation
- **Health-Based Selection**: Only healthy agents returned as dependencies
- **Identical Responses**: Registration and heartbeat return same structure
