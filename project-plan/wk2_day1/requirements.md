**Goal: Migrate MCP Mesh runtime components from Python to Go for enterprise-grade performance and K8s deployment**

# Migration Week 2, Day 1: Go Runtime Foundation - Registry Service and CLI

## Primary Objectives
- Migrate registry service from Python FastAPI to Go Gin/Echo
- Convert CLI from Python to Go with Cobra framework
- Maintain 100% API compatibility with existing Python implementation
- Establish Go development environment and build pipeline

## Go Runtime Requirements
- Registry service with identical HTTP API endpoints as Python version
- CLI tool with same commands, flags, and behavior as Python version
- Same database schema and migration support (SQLite/PostgreSQL)
- Identical environment variable handling and configuration patterns

## Technical Requirements
- Go registry service replacing Python FastAPI implementation
- Go CLI tool replacing Python Click-based mcp_mesh_dev command
- Same REST API endpoints: `/agents/register_with_metadata`, `/agents`, `/heartbeat`, `/health`
- Same CLI commands: `start`, `list`, `stop`, `status` with identical flags
- Cross-platform binary distribution for Windows, macOS, Linux
- Docker containerization for K8s deployment

## Compatibility Requirements
- 100% HTTP API compatibility - existing Python decorators must work unchanged
- Same configuration file formats and environment variables
- Identical process management behavior and signal handling
- Same logging output format and error messages
- Backward compatibility with existing agent implementations

## Performance Targets
- Registry service: 10x throughput improvement over Python FastAPI
- CLI startup time: <100ms (vs ~500ms Python)
- Memory usage: 50% reduction for long-running registry service
- Docker image size: <50MB for registry service

## Success Criteria
- Go registry service passes all existing Python registry tests
- Go CLI successfully manages same Python agent processes
- Zero breaking changes for existing @mesh_agent decorator usage
- Performance benchmarks meet or exceed targets
- Cross-platform binaries work on all supported platforms
