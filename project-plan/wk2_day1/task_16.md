# Task 16: MCP FastAPI HTTP Wrapper Integration (3 hours)

## Overview: Distributed MCP Agent Network Architecture

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: This task implements the revolutionary transformation of local MCP functions into distributed, network-accessible HTTP services. This is the foundational technology that enables MCP agents to run in containers/pods and communicate across network boundaries.

**Reference Documents**:

- `ARCHITECTURAL_CONCEPTS_AND_DEVELOPER_RULES.md` - Complete architecture overview
- `examples/hello_world.py` - Reference Python MCP agent implementation
- `packages/mcp_mesh_runtime/src/mcp_mesh_runtime/decorators/mesh_agent.py` - Current mesh decorator

## REVOLUTIONARY ARCHITECTURE VISION

**GAME-CHANGING INSIGHT**: We are solving the distributed MCP problem before the MCP community realizes they need it. This transforms MCP from localhost-only subprocess execution to a scalable, containerized service mesh.

**The Transformation**:

```python
# User writes this simple code
@mesh_agent
def weather_service():
    return get_weather()

# Behind the scenes, our mesh automatically:
# 1. Wraps function in MCP server
# 2. Adds FastAPI HTTP layer using mcp.server.fastapi
# 3. Starts HTTP server on available port
# 4. Registers with service discovery: http://pod-ip:port/mcp
# 5. Enables cross-container dependency injection
```

**Kubernetes Native Architecture**:

- Every agent = containerized MCP server with HTTP wrapper
- Automatic service discovery and registration
- Seamless dependency injection across containers/pods
- Load balancing and scaling via K8s services
- Interface-optional pattern - no Protocol definitions needed

## Implementation Requirements

### 16.1: Core HTTP Wrapper Implementation

- [ ] Create `HttpMcpWrapper` class in `packages/mcp_mesh_runtime/src/mcp_mesh_runtime/server/http_wrapper.py`
- [ ] Implement MCP server creation from decorated functions
- [ ] Integrate `mcp.server.fastapi.create_app()` for HTTP wrapper
- [ ] Add uvicorn server management with proper lifecycle
- [ ] Implement port auto-assignment and endpoint URL generation
- [ ] Add graceful server shutdown and cleanup

### 16.2: Enhanced Mesh Decorator Integration

- [ ] Modify `MeshAgentDecorator` to create `HttpMcpWrapper` instances
- [ ] Update immediate initialization to start HTTP servers
- [ ] Enhance registry registration with HTTP endpoint URLs
- [ ] Add HTTP server status to health monitoring
- [ ] Implement proper error handling and fallback modes
- [ ] Add debug logging for HTTP server lifecycle events

### 16.3: Registry Client HTTP Support

- [ ] Add `register_http_agent()` method for HTTP-enabled agents
- [ ] Update health monitoring to include HTTP server status
- [ ] Enhance agent metadata with transport and protocol information
- [ ] Add HTTP-specific error handling and retry logic
- [ ] Support load balancing metadata for K8s services

### 16.4: Cross-Container Communication

- [ ] Implement HTTP client for calling remote mesh agents
- [ ] Add service discovery integration for HTTP endpoints
- [ ] Create proxy objects for dependency injection across containers
- [ ] Implement retry logic and circuit breaker patterns
- [ ] Add load balancing support for multiple agent replicas

### 16.5: Container/Kubernetes Integration

- [ ] Create example Dockerfile for containerized agents
- [ ] Add K8s deployment manifests with proper service configuration
- [ ] Implement environment variable configuration for container deployments
- [ ] Add health check endpoints for K8s liveness/readiness probes
- [ ] Create service discovery examples for multi-container scenarios

## Success Criteria

### Core HTTP Functionality

- [ ] **CRITICAL**: All `@mesh_agent` decorated functions automatically start HTTP servers
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Functions are accessible via HTTP using MCP protocol
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Port auto-assignment works reliably without conflicts
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: HTTP servers start and stop gracefully with proper cleanup
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Registry registration includes correct HTTP endpoint URLs

### Cross-Container Communication

- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Agents in different containers can call each other via HTTP
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Dependency injection works across container boundaries
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Service discovery resolves HTTP endpoints correctly
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Load balancing distributes calls across multiple replicas
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Error handling provides graceful degradation for network issues

### Kubernetes Integration

- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Agents deploy successfully in K8s pods with HTTP endpoints
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: K8s services provide load balancing across agent replicas
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Service discovery works through K8s DNS resolution
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Pod restarts maintain service continuity
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Health checks accurately reflect agent status

This task represents a revolutionary leap forward - transforming MCP from local subprocess execution to a distributed, scalable service mesh that's ready for enterprise Kubernetes deployments.
