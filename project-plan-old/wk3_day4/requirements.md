# Week 3, Day 4: Advanced Enterprise Authentication

## Primary Objectives
- Enhance enterprise authentication with advanced features
- Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA)
- Create certificate-based authentication for agents
- Build session management and security hardening

## MCP SDK Requirements
- MFA integration maintaining MCP protocol flow
- Certificate-based authentication for MCP agents
- Enhanced session security for MCP connections
- Security hardening without breaking MCP compatibility

## Technical Requirements
- Multi-factor authentication with TOTP/SMS support
- X.509 certificate management for agent authentication
- Advanced session management with security controls
- Security hardening and vulnerability mitigation
- Integration testing with all authentication methods

## Success Criteria
- MFA provides additional security layer for sensitive operations
- Certificate-based authentication secures agent-to-agent communication
- Session management prevents security vulnerabilities
- Security hardening protects against common attack vectors
