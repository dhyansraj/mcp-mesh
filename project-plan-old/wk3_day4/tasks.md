# Week 3, Day 4: Advanced Enterprise Authentication - Tasks

## Morning (4 hours)
### Multi-Factor Authentication
- [ ] Implement MFA system:
  - TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) support
  - SMS-based verification codes
  - Backup recovery codes for account recovery
  - MFA enrollment and setup process
- [ ] Create MFA management tools:
  - enable_mfa(user_id: str, method: str) -> MfaResult
  - verify_mfa(user_id: str, code: str) -> VerificationResult
  - generate_backup_codes(user_id: str) -> List[str]
  - disable_mfa(user_id: str, verification: str) -> DisableResult

### Certificate-Based Authentication
- [ ] Implement certificate management:
  - X.509 certificate generation and validation
  - Certificate authority (CA) setup and management
  - Certificate signing and verification workflows
  - Certificate revocation and renewal procedures
- [ ] Add certificate authentication for agents:
  - Agent certificate enrollment process
  - Mutual TLS authentication for agent connections
  - Certificate-based agent identity verification
  - Integration with MCP protocol security

## Afternoon (4 hours)
### Advanced Session Management
- [ ] Enhance session security:
  - Session fingerprinting and validation
  - Concurrent session management and limits
  - Session hijacking prevention measures
  - Idle timeout and forced logout procedures
- [ ] Implement session management tools:
  - get_active_sessions(user_id: str) -> List[Session]
  - terminate_session(session_id: str, reason: str) -> TerminationResult
  - validate_session(session_id: str) -> ValidationResult

### Security Hardening
- [ ] Apply security hardening measures:
  - Rate limiting for authentication attempts
  - Account lockout policies for failed logins
  - Password policy enforcement
  - Security headers and CSRF protection
- [ ] Conduct security testing:
  - Penetration testing for authentication flows
  - Vulnerability scanning and remediation
  - Security compliance validation
  - Integration testing with all authentication methods
