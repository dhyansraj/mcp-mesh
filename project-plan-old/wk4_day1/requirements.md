**Goal: An enterprise AI framework for maximum official MCP SDK compliance with minimum boiler plate code for users**

# Week 4, Day 1: Helm Charts and Kubernetes Manifests

## Primary Objectives
- Create comprehensive Helm charts for MCP framework deployment
- Design Kubernetes manifests for production environments
- Implement configuration management for containerized deployments
- Establish deployment automation and CI/CD integration

## MCP SDK Requirements
- Kubernetes deployment supporting MCP agent scaling
- Container configuration maintaining MCP protocol compliance
- Service discovery integration with Kubernetes DNS
- ConfigMap and Secret management for MCP agent configuration

## Technical Requirements
- Helm charts with configurable values for different environments
- Kubernetes manifests for all framework components
- Container image optimization and security scanning
- Deployment automation with rollback capabilities
- Integration with existing configuration system

## Success Criteria
- Helm charts successfully deploy MCP framework to Kubernetes
- Kubernetes manifests support production-grade configurations
- Deployment automation enables reliable and repeatable deployments
- Container security and optimization meets enterprise standards
