# Week 1, Day 4: Registry Service Advanced Features - Tasks

## Morning (4 hours)
### Advanced Service Discovery with Decorator Pattern Integration
**⚠️ CRITICAL: Registry discovers agents through @mesh_agent decorator metadata!**
- [ ] Implement semantic capability matching:
  - Capability hierarchy and inheritance from @mesh_agent decorators
  - Complex query language for capability search
  - Compatibility scoring for agent selection based on decorator metadata
- [ ] Add advanced discovery MCP tools:
  - query_agents(query: CapabilityQuery) -> List[AgentMatch]
  - get_best_agent(requirements: Requirements) -> AgentInfo  
  - check_compatibility(agent_id: str, requirements: Requirements) -> CompatibilityScore
- [ ] Integrate with @mesh_agent decorator pattern:
  - Automatic capability registration from decorator metadata
  - Health interval extraction from decorator configuration
  - Dependency injection based on decorator specifications

### Agent Versioning System
- [ ] Design agent versioning schema
- [ ] Implement version tracking and comparison
- [ ] Add deployment history and rollback capabilities
- [ ] Create versioning MCP tools:
  - get_agent_versions(agent_id: str) -> List[VersionInfo]
  - deploy_agent_version(agent_id: str, version: str) -> DeploymentResult

## Afternoon (4 hours)
### MCP Server Lifecycle Management
- [ ] Implement lifecycle management system:
  - Server start/stop/restart operations
  - Graceful shutdown with connection draining
  - Health monitoring during lifecycle transitions
- [ ] Create lifecycle MCP tools:
  - start_agent(agent_id: str) -> OperationResult
  - stop_agent(agent_id: str, graceful: bool) -> OperationResult
  - restart_agent(agent_id: str) -> OperationResult

### Load Balancing and Configuration
- [ ] Implement load balancing algorithms:
  - Round-robin and weighted distribution
  - Health-aware request routing
  - Circuit breaker pattern for failed agents
- [ ] Add configuration management for registry settings
- [ ] Create comprehensive integration tests
- [ ] Document advanced registry features and APIs
