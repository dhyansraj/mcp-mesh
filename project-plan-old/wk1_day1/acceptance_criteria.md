# Week 1, Day 1: MCP SDK Integration Setup - Acceptance Criteria

## Environment Setup Criteria
✅ **AC-1.1**: MCP Python SDK and dependencies are successfully installed and functional
- [ ] MCP Python SDK version ≥ latest stable installed in virtual environment
- [ ] All required dependencies (FastMCP, type annotations, etc.) installed
- [ ] Virtual environment properly configured with requirements.txt
- [ ] Development tools (linting, type checking) configured and operational

✅ **AC-1.2**: Project repository structure follows MCP SDK best practices
- [ ] Directory structure adheres to MCP Python SDK recommended layout
- [ ] Proper separation of concerns (agents, common, protocols, etc.)
- [ ] Git repository initialized with appropriate .gitignore
- [ ] Development documentation structure established

## MCP SDK Integration Criteria
✅ **AC-2.1**: Minimal "Hello World" MCP server successfully created and tested
- [ ] FastMCP server responds to basic MCP protocol requests
- [ ] Server can be started and stopped without errors
- [ ] MCP client can successfully connect to server
- [ ] Basic protocol compliance verified (handshake, tool discovery)

✅ **AC-2.2**: MCP protocol compliance framework operational
- [ ] Testing framework validates MCP protocol message format
- [ ] Type safety maintained throughout MCP message handling
- [ ] Async patterns properly implemented for MCP operations
- [ ] Error handling follows MCP SDK best practices

## File Agent Implementation Criteria
✅ **AC-3.1**: Custom @mesh_agent decorator pattern implemented and functional
- [ ] @mesh_agent decorator reduces boilerplate code for agent registration
- [ ] Decorator integrates seamlessly with @server.tool decorators
- [ ] Automatic capability registration from decorator metadata
- [ ] Health monitoring integration via decorator parameters

✅ **AC-3.2**: File Agent implements all required core operations
- [ ] `read_file(path: str) -> str` tool with proper error handling
- [ ] `write_file(path: str, content: str) -> bool` tool with validation
- [ ] `list_directory(path: str) -> List[str]` tool with permissions check
- [ ] All tools properly typed and documented with type annotations

✅ **AC-3.3**: File Agent demonstrates MCP protocol compliance
- [ ] File Agent responds correctly to MCP tool discovery requests
- [ ] All file operations return properly formatted MCP responses
- [ ] Error cases handled with appropriate MCP error responses
- [ ] Progress reporting functional for long-running operations

## Documentation and Testing Criteria
✅ **AC-4.1**: Development documentation enables team collaboration
- [ ] Project setup instructions are clear and complete
- [ ] MCP SDK usage patterns documented with examples
- [ ] Development workflow documented (testing, linting, etc.)
- [ ] Architecture decisions recorded with rationale

✅ **AC-4.2**: Testing framework validates MCP compliance and functionality
- [ ] Unit tests cover all File Agent tools
- [ ] Integration tests validate MCP protocol compliance
- [ ] Continuous integration pipeline configured
- [ ] Test coverage meets minimum threshold (80%+)

## Success Validation Criteria
✅ **AC-5.1**: End-to-end functionality demonstration
- [ ] File Agent can be started as MCP server
- [ ] External MCP client can connect and discover tools
- [ ] All file operations work correctly through MCP protocol
- [ ] Error scenarios handled gracefully with proper MCP responses

✅ **AC-5.2**: Development environment ready for team expansion
- [ ] New developers can set up environment in < 15 minutes
- [ ] All development tools work consistently across team
- [ ] Code quality standards enforced through automated tooling
- [ ] Documentation enables independent development progress
