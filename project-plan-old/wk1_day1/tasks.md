# Week 1, Day 1: MCP SDK Integration Setup - Tasks

## Morning (4 hours)
### Environment Setup
- [ ] Install MCP Python SDK and dependencies
- [ ] Create project repository structure
- [ ] Set up virtual environment and requirements.txt
- [ ] Configure development tools (linting, type checking)

### MCP SDK Exploration
- [ ] Study FastMCP documentation and examples
- [ ] Create minimal "Hello World" MCP server
- [ ] Test server with MCP client connection
- [ ] Verify protocol compliance with basic operations

## Afternoon (4 hours)
### File Agent Foundation with Custom Decorator Pattern
- [ ] Design File Agent architecture using MCP SDK patterns
- [ ] Implement custom @mesh_agent decorator to reduce boilerplate:
  ```python
  @mesh_agent(capabilities=["file_read", "file_write"], health_interval=30)
  @server.tool()
  async def read_file(path: str) -> str:
      # Implementation with automatic mesh integration
  ```
- [ ] Implement basic file operations with decorator pattern:
  - read_file(path: str) -> str (with @mesh_agent decorator)
  - write_file(path: str, content: str) -> bool (with @mesh_agent decorator)
  - list_directory(path: str) -> List[str] (with @mesh_agent decorator)
- [ ] Add proper error handling and type annotations
- [ ] Test File Agent with MCP protocol requests and mesh integration

### Documentation and Testing
- [ ] Create development documentation for MCP SDK usage
- [ ] Write basic unit tests for File Agent tools
- [ ] Set up continuous integration for MCP compliance testing
- [ ] Document project structure and development workflow
