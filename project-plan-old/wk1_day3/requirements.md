**Goal: An enterprise AI framework for maximum official MCP SDK compliance with minimum boiler plate code for users**

# Week 1, Day 3: Registry Service Foundation

## Primary Objectives
- Implement Registry Service core architecture using MCP SDK patterns
- Create service discovery mechanism for MCP agents
- Build agent registration and health reporting system
- Establish MCP server lifecycle management
- No boiler plat code required for Agents or sample code. @mesh_agent should handle all registry functionalities behind the scene

## MCP SDK Requirements
- Registry Service as central MCP server using FastMCP
- Service discovery API following MCP protocol specifications
- Agent registration using MCP-compliant resource patterns
- Health monitoring with MCP-standard status reporting

## Technical Requirements
- Registry Service with REST API and MCP protocol support
- Agent registration endpoint with metadata validation
- Health check system with heartbeat monitoring
- Service discovery with capability-based filtering
- SQLite database for agent registry persistence

## Success Criteria
- Registry Service successfully registers and tracks MCP agents
- Service discovery API returns available agents and capabilities
- Health monitoring detects and reports agent status changes
- MCP protocol compliance maintained for all registry operations
- All existing agents in samples directory integrated to registry with no modification to source code (Any modification permitted is only to @mesh_agent decorator)
