**Goal: An enterprise AI framework for maximum official MCP SDK compliance with minimum boiler plate code for users**

# Week 3, Day 1: RBAC Implementation Foundation

## Primary Objectives
- Design and implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system
- Create user and role management with MCP agent integration
- Build permission framework for agent access control
- Establish authentication layer for MCP protocol security

## MCP SDK Requirements
- RBAC integration with MCP agent authentication
- Permission-based access to MCP tools and resources
- Role-based filtering of MCP capabilities
- Secure authentication preserving MCP protocol integrity

## Technical Requirements
- User management system with role assignments
- Permission framework with granular access controls
- Authentication middleware for MCP connections
- Role-based agent access and capability filtering
- Integration with existing Registry Service and configuration system

## Success Criteria
- RBAC system successfully controls access to agent operations
- Users can be assigned roles with appropriate permissions
- MCP protocol security enhanced without breaking compatibility
- Permission changes take effect immediately across agent network
