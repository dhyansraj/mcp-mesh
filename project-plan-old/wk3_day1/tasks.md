# Week 3, Day 1: RBAC Implementation Foundation - Tasks

## Morning (4 hours)
### RBAC System Design
- [ ] Design RBAC data model:
  - User entities with authentication credentials
  - Role definitions with permission sets
  - Permission granularity for agent operations
  - Group management for user organization
- [ ] Create RBAC database schema:
  - Users table with authentication data
  - Roles table with role definitions
  - Permissions table with operation mappings
  - User-role and role-permission junction tables
- [ ] Implement core RBAC entities:
  - User class with authentication methods
  - Role class with permission management
  - Permission class with operation definitions

### User Management System
- [ ] Build user management functionality:
  - User registration and authentication
  - Password hashing and security
  - User profile management
  - Account activation and deactivation
- [ ] Create user management MCP tools:
  - create_user(username: str, password: str, roles: List[str]) -> UserResult
  - update_user(user_id: str, updates: UserUpdate) -> UpdateResult
  - delete_user(user_id: str) -> DeletionResult
  - list_users(filters: UserFilters) -> List[User]

## Afternoon (4 hours)
### Role and Permission Framework
- [ ] Implement role management system:
  - Role creation and modification
  - Permission assignment to roles
  - Role inheritance and composition
  - Default role templates for common use cases
- [ ] Create permission framework:
  - Permission definitions for agent operations
  - Resource-based permission scoping
  - Permission evaluation and enforcement
  - Permission caching for performance
- [ ] Add role management MCP tools:
  - create_role(name: str, permissions: List[str]) -> RoleResult
  - assign_role(user_id: str, role_id: str) -> AssignmentResult
  - revoke_role(user_id: str, role_id: str) -> RevocationResult
  - get_user_permissions(user_id: str) -> List[Permission]

### Authentication Integration
- [ ] Integrate RBAC with MCP authentication:
  - Authentication middleware for MCP connections
  - Token-based authentication for API access
  - Session management and timeout handling
  - Integration with existing agent registry
- [ ] Test RBAC system functionality:
  - User creation and role assignment
  - Permission evaluation for agent operations
  - Authentication flow with MCP agents
  - Performance testing with multiple users
