# Week 3, Day 1: RBAC Implementation Foundation - Acceptance Criteria

## Developer Rules Compliance
- [ ] **MCP SDK First**: RBAC system uses official MCP SDK patterns for authentication and authorization without bypassing core functionality
- [ ] **Package Architecture**: RBAC interfaces in `mcp-mesh-types`, implementations in `mcp-mesh`, examples import from types only
- [ ] **MCP Compatibility**: RBAC works in vanilla MCP environment with types package, enhanced features activate with full package
- [ ] **Community Ready**: RBAC examples demonstrate proper MCP SDK patterns first, mesh features as optional enhancements

## RBAC System Design and Data Model
✅ **AC-3.1.1** RBAC data model supports enterprise user and role management
- [ ] User entities with secure authentication credentials properly defined

- [ ] Group management enables efficient user organization and administration

✅ **AC-3.1.2** RBAC database schema enables scalable permission management
- [ ] Users table with secure authentication data and profile information
- [ ] Roles table with role definitions and hierarchical relationships
- [ ] Permissions table with fine-grained operation mappings

## User Management System
✅ **AC-3.1.3** User management functionality provides comprehensive account lifecycle
- [ ] User registration and authentication with password security standards
- [ ] Password hashing using industry-standard algorithms (bcrypt/scrypt)
- [ ] User profile management with role assignment and access controls
- [ ] Account activation and deactivation with proper state management

✅ **AC-3.1.4** User management MCP tools enable programmatic administration
- [ ] create_user() function properly registered with @server.tool decorator
- [ ] update_user() supports profile updates with validation and security checks
- [ ] delete_user() handles account removal with data retention policies
- [ ] list_users() provides filtered user listings with pagination support

## Role and Permission Framework
✅ **AC-3.1.5** Role management system enables flexible permission assignment
- [ ] Role creation and modification with validation and conflict detection
- [ ] Permission assignment to roles with inheritance and composition support
- [ ] Role inheritance enables hierarchical permission structures
- [ ] Default role templates available for common use cases and scenarios

✅ **AC-3.1.6** Permission framework provides granular access control
- [ ] Permission definitions cover all agent operations and resource types
- [ ] Resource-based permission scoping (agent-specific, tool-specific, global)
- [ ] Permission evaluation engine provides fast, accurate authorization decisions
- [ ] Permission caching optimizes performance for frequent authorization requests

## Role Management MCP Tools
✅ **AC-3.1.7** Role management tools integrate with MCP protocol
- [ ] create_role() function registered with @server.tool and creates roles with permissions
- [ ] assign_role() properly assigns roles to users with validation
- [ ] revoke_role() removes role assignments with audit trail
- [ ] get_user_permissions() provides comprehensive permission listing for authorization

✅ **AC-3.1.8** Role tools maintain MCP SDK compliance and functionality
- [ ] All role management functions use proper MCP SDK tool registration patterns
- [ ] Role tools integrate with MCP error handling and response patterns
- [ ] Permission queries optimize MCP protocol message efficiency
- [ ] Role operations maintain MCP connection stability and performance

## Authentication Integration
✅ **AC-3.1.9** RBAC integrates with MCP authentication without breaking compatibility
- [ ] Authentication middleware integrated with MCP connection handling
- [ ] Token-based authentication supports API access with proper security
- [ ] Session management with timeout handling prevents unauthorized access
- [ ] Integration with agent registry maintains existing MCP functionality

✅ **AC-3.1.10** Authentication preserves MCP protocol flow and standards
- [ ] MCP protocol handshake enhanced with authentication without breaking compatibility
- [ ] Agent authentication maintains MCP SDK connection patterns
- [ ] Authentication errors properly formatted as MCP protocol responses
- [ ] Session state management compatible with MCP connection lifecycle

## Security and Performance
✅ **AC-3.1.11** RBAC system meets enterprise security requirements
- [ ] Password security follows OWASP guidelines and industry standards
- [ ] Authentication tokens use secure generation and validation
- [ ] Session management prevents session hijacking and fixation attacks
- [ ] Authorization decisions consistent and tamper-resistant

✅ **AC-3.1.12** Performance requirements met under enterprise load
- [ ] User authentication completes within 500ms under normal load
- [ ] Permission evaluation takes <100ms for complex permission hierarchies
- [ ] Role assignment operations complete within 2 seconds
- [ ] User listing supports pagination for 10,000+ user enterprises

## Integration and Compatibility
✅ **AC-3.1.13** RBAC system integrates with existing framework components
- [ ] Registry Service integration supports agent-level access controls
- [ ] Configuration system integration enables role-based configuration access
- [ ] Dashboard integration shows user and role management interfaces
- [ ] Monitoring system tracks authentication and authorization events

✅ **AC-3.1.14** Enterprise authentication systems preparation
- [ ] RBAC architecture designed for SSO integration (preparation for Day 3)
- [ ] LDAP/Active Directory integration points identified and prepared
- [ ] API key authentication framework prepared for programmatic access
- [ ] Audit logging hooks prepared for comprehensive security monitoring

## Testing and Validation
✅ **AC-3.1.15** Comprehensive testing validates RBAC functionality
- [ ] Unit tests cover all user and role management operations
- [ ] Integration tests validate authentication flow with MCP agents
- [ ] Security tests verify protection against common attack vectors
- [ ] Performance tests confirm system behavior under realistic load

✅ **AC-3.1.16** Edge cases and error scenarios properly handled
- [ ] Invalid authentication attempts handled gracefully with proper logging
- [ ] Role assignment conflicts resolved with clear error messages
- [ ] Permission inheritance cycles detected and prevented
- [ ] System recovers gracefully from authentication service temporary failures
