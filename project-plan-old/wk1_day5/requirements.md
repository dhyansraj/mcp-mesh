# Week 1, Day 5: Basic Orchestration - Intent Agent and Routing

## Primary Objectives
- Implement Intent Agent for intelligent request routing
- Create basic orchestration logic using MCP SDK patterns
- Build inter-agent communication framework
- Establish request routing and response aggregation

## MCP SDK Requirements
- Intent Agent as central orchestration MCP server
- Request routing using MCP protocol message patterns
- Inter-agent communication through MCP client connections
- Response aggregation maintaining MCP protocol compliance

## Technical Requirements
- Intent Agent with natural language understanding for routing
- Basic orchestration engine for multi-agent workflows
- Inter-agent communication protocol and message passing
- Request routing based on capability matching
- Response aggregation and formatting system

## Success Criteria
- Intent Agent successfully routes requests to appropriate agents
- Basic multi-agent workflows execute correctly
- Inter-agent communication works reliably
- Response aggregation produces coherent results from multiple agents
