# Week 1, Day 5: Basic Orchestration - Intent Agent and Routing - Tasks

## Morning (4 hours)
### Intent Agent Foundation with Decorator Pattern
**⚠️ NOTE: Intent Agent is an EXAMPLE in examples/ directory, not core platform!**
- [ ] Design Intent Agent architecture using FastMCP and @mesh_agent decorator
- [ ] Implement Intent Agent as example in examples/agents/intent_agent.py:
  ```python
  @mesh_agent(capabilities=["intent_routing", "orchestration"], health_interval=30)
  @server.tool()
  async def process_request(user_input: str) -> RoutingPlan:
      # Example implementation showing decorator usage
  ```
- [ ] Implement basic intent recognition in examples directory:
  - Simple keyword-based intent matching
  - Intent to capability mapping  
  - Request context extraction
- [ ] Create Intent Agent example tools:
  - process_request(user_input: str) -> RoutingPlan
  - execute_plan(plan: RoutingPlan) -> ExecutionResult
  - get_available_capabilities() -> List[Capability]

### Request Routing System
- [ ] Implement routing logic:
  - Capability-based agent selection
  - Request decomposition for multi-agent workflows
  - Priority and dependency handling
- [ ] Create routing algorithms:
  - Single-agent routing for simple requests
  - Multi-agent orchestration for complex requests
  - Fallback mechanisms for routing failures

## Afternoon (4 hours)
### Inter-Agent Communication
- [ ] Implement MCP client pool for agent connections
- [ ] Create message passing framework:
  - Async communication between agents
  - Request/response correlation
  - Timeout and error handling
- [ ] Add communication tools:
  - send_request(agent_id: str, request: Request) -> Response
  - broadcast_request(request: Request) -> List[Response]
  - check_agent_status(agent_id: str) -> Status

### Response Aggregation and Testing
- [ ] Implement response aggregation:
  - Multi-response merging strategies
  - Result formatting and validation
  - Error consolidation and reporting
- [ ] Create end-to-end orchestration tests
- [ ] Test multi-agent workflow scenarios
- [ ] Document orchestration patterns and best practices
