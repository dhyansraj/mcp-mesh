**Goal: An enterprise AI framework for maximum official MCP SDK compliance with minimum boiler plate code for users**

# Week 5, Day 5: Example Implementations and Integration Showcase

## Primary Objectives
- Create real-world agent examples demonstrating MCP SDK integration
- Develop integration examples with popular enterprise tools and services
- Build comprehensive example repository with testing and validation
- Establish showcase demonstrations highlighting framework capabilities

## MCP SDK Requirements
- All examples must demonstrate proper MCP SDK usage patterns
- Integration examples maintain full MCP protocol compatibility
- Example agents follow MCP SDK best practices and conventions
- Showcase implementations highlight MCP ecosystem interoperability

## Technical Requirements

### Real-World Agent Examples
- **GitHub Integration Agent**: Repository management, issue tracking, PR automation
- **Slack Notification Agent**: Real-time messaging, channel management, user interactions
- **Database Query Agent**: SQL operations, data analysis, reporting capabilities
- **File Processing Pipeline**: Document processing, transformation, workflow automation
- **API Integration Agent**: External service integration, data synchronization

### Enterprise Integration Showcase
- Authentication and identity provider integrations
- Monitoring and observability tool integrations
- CI/CD pipeline and DevOps tool integrations
- Enterprise messaging and communication platform integrations
- Business intelligence and analytics tool integrations

### Example Repository Structure
- Production-ready code with comprehensive documentation
- Testing frameworks and validation procedures
- Deployment configurations and environment setup
- Performance benchmarking and optimization examples
- Community contribution guidelines and templates

### Interactive Demonstrations
- Live demo environment with example agents
- Interactive tutorials walking through example implementations
- Performance benchmarking and comparison demonstrations
- Integration testing and validation showcases
- Community showcase platform for sharing implementations

## Example Agent Specifications

### GitHub Integration Agent
```python
# MCP SDK integration for GitHub operations
@server.tool
async def create_pull_request(title: str, body: str, base: str, head: str):
    """Create GitHub pull request using MCP SDK patterns"""
    
@server.resource
async def repository_info(repo: str) -> GitHubRepo:
    """Get repository information with MCP SDK resource pattern"""
```

### Slack Notification Agent
```python
# Real-time messaging with MCP SDK
@server.tool
async def send_message(channel: str, message: str, thread_ts: str = None):
    """Send Slack message using MCP SDK tool pattern"""
    
@server.resource
async def channel_list() -> List[SlackChannel]:
    """List Slack channels with MCP SDK resource pattern"""
```
