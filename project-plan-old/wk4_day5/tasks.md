# Week 4, Day 5: Production Deployment Testing - Tasks

## Morning (4 hours)
### Production Environment Setup
- [ ] Deploy complete production environment:
  - Set up production-like Kubernetes cluster with multiple nodes
  - Deploy complete MCP framework using final Helm charts
  - Configure production networking, load balancers, and ingress
  - Set up external dependencies (databases, authentication services)
- [ ] Validate production configuration:
  - Verify all services running with production resource limits
  - Validate security configurations and RBAC policies
  - Test Prometheus/Grafana monitoring in production environment
  - Confirm service mesh and observability stack operational
- [ ] Create baseline performance metrics:
  - Establish performance baselines for all components
  - Document resource utilization under normal operation
  - Create reference metrics for comparison during testing
  - Set up Prometheus AlertManager for basic notifications

### Load Testing Infrastructure
- [ ] Set up comprehensive load testing framework:
  - Deploy load testing tools (k6, JMeter, or custom tools)
  - Create realistic user scenarios and test data
  - Configure load generation to simulate various agent types
  - Set up distributed load testing across multiple clients
- [ ] Implement MCP protocol load testing:
  - Create MCP-specific load testing scenarios
  - Test registry service under high agent registration load
  - Simulate concurrent MCP protocol connections and messages
  - Test agent performance under various workload patterns

## Afternoon (4 hours)
### Comprehensive Load Testing Execution
- [ ] Execute graduated load testing scenarios:
  - Normal load: 100 agents, 1000 requests/minute baseline
  - Peak load: 500 agents, 5000 requests/minute capacity testing
  - Stress load: 1000 agents, 10000 requests/minute breaking point
  - Burst load: Sudden spike testing auto-scaling response
- [ ] Monitor and analyze performance:
  - Real-time monitoring during load tests
  - Resource utilization analysis and bottleneck identification
  - Auto-scaling behavior validation and optimization
  - Performance degradation analysis and mitigation

### Chaos Engineering and Failure Testing
- [ ] Execute failure scenario testing:
  - Pod failure and automatic recovery validation
  - Node failure and cluster resilience testing
  - Network partition and split-brain scenario simulation
  - Database failure and recovery procedure validation
- [ ] Security and disaster recovery testing:
  - Security breach simulation and response validation
  - Backup and restore procedure testing
  - Disaster recovery scenario execution
  - Data integrity validation during failures
- [ ] Complete production readiness assessment:
  - Security audit and vulnerability assessment
  - Performance benchmarking and capacity planning documentation
  - Operational runbook validation and testing
  - Compliance verification and documentation
