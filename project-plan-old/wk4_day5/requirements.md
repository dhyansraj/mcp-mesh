**Goal: An enterprise AI framework for maximum official MCP SDK compliance with minimum boiler plate code for users**

# Week 4, Day 5: Production Deployment Testing

## Primary Objectives
- Conduct comprehensive end-to-end production validation
- Perform load testing and performance validation under realistic conditions
- Execute failure scenario testing (chaos engineering)
- Complete production readiness assessment and documentation

## MCP SDK Requirements
- Production testing must validate MCP protocol performance under load
- Failure scenarios test MCP SDK resilience and recovery capabilities
- Load testing validates MCP agent scaling and connection management
- Performance testing ensures MCP SDK functionality meets production standards

## Technical Requirements

### Production Environment Setup
- Production-like Kubernetes cluster configuration
- Complete MCP framework deployment using final Helm charts
- Production-grade networking, security, and monitoring configuration
- External dependencies simulation (databases, authentication, APIs)
- Realistic data volumes and user scenarios

### Load Testing and Performance Validation
- Comprehensive load testing scenarios for all MCP framework components
- Registry service performance under high agent registration load
- Agent performance testing with concurrent MCP protocol connections
- Database and storage performance under production workloads
- Network performance and throughput validation

### Failure Scenario Testing (Chaos Engineering)
- Pod failure and recovery testing
- Node failure and cluster resilience validation
- Network partition and split-brain scenario testing
- Database failure and recovery procedures
- Security breach simulation and response validation

### Production Readiness Assessment
- Security audit and vulnerability assessment
- Performance benchmarking and capacity planning
- Disaster recovery and backup procedure validation
- Operational runbook creation and validation
- Compliance verification (SOC2 readiness)

## Performance Targets
- Registry service: <100ms response time under 1000 concurrent agents
- Agent startup time: <30 seconds including MCP SDK initialization
- Auto-scaling response: <60 seconds for scale-up under load
- System recovery: <5 minutes for most failure scenarios
- Data consistency: 100% data integrity during failures

## Load Testing Scenarios
- **Normal Load**: 100 agents, 1000 requests/minute
- **Peak Load**: 500 agents, 5000 requests/minute
- **Stress Load**: 1000 agents, 10000 requests/minute
- **Burst Load**: Sudden spike from 100 to 1000 agents
- **Sustained Load**: 24-hour continuous operation

## Dependencies
- Complete monitoring and service mesh from Days 3-4
- Final Helm charts and deployment configuration
- Security framework and RBAC system
- All MCP framework components from Weeks 1-3

## Success Criteria
- All performance targets met under production load
- System gracefully handles all failure scenarios
- Production deployment successful with zero-downtime upgrades
- Comprehensive production readiness documentation complete
- Framework ready for Week 5 developer experience work
