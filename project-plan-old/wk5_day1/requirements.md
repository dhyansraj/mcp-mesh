**Goal: An enterprise AI framework for maximum official MCP SDK compliance with minimum boiler plate code for users**

# Week 5, Day 1: CLI Tools and Agent Scaffolding

## Primary Objectives
- Develop comprehensive CLI tools for MCP framework management
- Create agent scaffolding system using MCP SDK templates
- Implement configuration validation and development utilities
- Establish local development environment automation

## MCP SDK Requirements
- CLI tools must generate MCP SDK-compliant agent code
- Agent scaffolding follows official MCP SDK patterns and best practices
- Generated agents maintain full MCP protocol compatibility
- Development tools support MCP SDK debugging and testing workflows

## Technical Requirements

### MCP-Mesh CLI Core Features
- Project initialization and management commands
- Agent creation and scaffolding with MCP SDK integration
- Configuration validation and syntax checking
- Local development environment setup and management
- Deployment commands for various environments
- Debugging and troubleshooting utilities

### Agent Scaffolding System
- Template-based agent generation using MCP SDK patterns
- Support for different agent types (File, Command, Developer, Custom)
- Integration with MCP SDK decorators and lifecycle management
- Boilerplate code generation with minimal developer intervention
- Best practices enforcement through generated code structure

### Configuration Management Tools
- YAML configuration validation with schema enforcement
- Configuration diff and merge utilities
- Environment-specific configuration management
- Configuration migration and upgrade tools
- Integration with Kubernetes ConfigMaps

### Local Development Environment
- Docker-based local development setup
- Local Kubernetes integration (kind, minikube)
- Hot-reload development server for rapid iteration
- Local testing and validation tools
- Integration with MCP SDK development workflows

## CLI Command Structure
```bash
mcp-mesh init <project-name>          # Initialize new project
mcp-mesh agent create <agent-name>    # Generate MCP SDK agent
mcp-mesh config validate              # Validate configuration
mcp-mesh config diff <env1> <env2>    # Compare configurations
mcp-mesh deploy local                 # Deploy to local environment
mcp-mesh deploy <environment>         # Deploy to specified environment
mcp-mesh logs agent <agent-name>      # View agent logs
mcp-mesh debug agent <agent-name>     # Debug agent issues
mcp-mesh test integration             # Run integration tests
mcp-mesh status                       # Show system status
```

## Dependencies
- Completed MCP framework from Weeks 1-4
- Production-ready Helm charts and deployment
- Configuration system and validation schemas
- MCP SDK templates and examples

## Success Criteria
- CLI tools enabling 5-minute project setup
- Agent scaffolding generating production-ready MCP SDK code
- Configuration validation preventing deployment errors
- Local development environment streamlining developer workflow
- Complete developer productivity toolkit operational
