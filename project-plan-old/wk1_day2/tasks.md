# Week 1, Day 2: Command and Developer Agents - Tasks

## Morning (4 hours)
### Command Agent Implementation with Decorator Pattern
- [ ] Design Command Agent architecture with security constraints
- [ ] Implement core command tools using @mesh_agent + @server.tool decorators:
  ```python
  @mesh_agent(capabilities=["command_exec", "process_mgmt"], health_interval=15)
  @server.tool()
  async def execute_command(command: str, timeout: int = 30) -> CommandResult:
      # Implementation with automatic capability registration
  ```
- [ ] Implement command tools with mesh integration:
  - execute_command(command: str, timeout: int = 30) -> CommandResult
  - get_process_status(pid: int) -> ProcessInfo
  - kill_process(pid: int) -> bool
- [ ] Add command whitelist and security validation
- [ ] Implement async execution with progress tracking

### Security and Validation
- [ ] Create command validation and sanitization
- [ ] Implement permission checking for system operations
- [ ] Add audit logging for all command executions
- [ ] Test security boundaries and error handling

## Afternoon (4 hours)
### Developer Agent Implementation with Decorator Pattern
- [ ] Design Developer Agent with context management
- [ ] Implement development tools using @mesh_agent + @server.tool decorators:
  ```python
  @mesh_agent(capabilities=["code_analysis", "testing", "project_mgmt"], health_interval=30)
  @server.tool()
  async def analyze_code(file_path: str) -> CodeAnalysis:
      # Implementation with automatic capability registration and health monitoring
  ```
- [ ] Implement development tools with mesh integration:
  - analyze_code(file_path: str) -> CodeAnalysis
  - run_tests(test_path: str) -> TestResults  
  - format_code(file_path: str) -> bool
  - get_project_structure() -> ProjectTree
- [ ] Add context preservation across operations
- [ ] Implement integration with common development tools

### Integration and Testing
- [ ] Create comprehensive test suite for both agents
- [ ] Test async operations and progress reporting
- [ ] Validate MCP protocol compliance for all new tools
- [ ] Document agent capabilities and usage examples
