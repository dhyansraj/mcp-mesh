# Week 1, Day 2: Command and Developer Agents - Acceptance Criteria

## Developer Rules Compliance
- [ ] **MCP SDK First**: All MCP features use official SDK (@app.tool(), protocol handling) without bypassing or reimplementing
- [ ] **Package Architecture**: Interfaces/stubs in mcp-mesh-types, implementations in mcp-mesh, samples import from types only
- [ ] **MCP Compatibility**: Code works in vanilla MCP environment with types package, enhanced features activate with full package
- [ ] **Community Ready**: Examples demonstrate proper MCP SDK patterns first, mesh features as optional enhancements

## Command Agent Implementation Criteria
✅ **AC-1.1**: Command Agent architecture with security constraints operational
- [ ] Command Agent implements secure system operation capabilities
- [ ] Security validation prevents unauthorized command execution
- [ ] Command whitelist properly configured and enforced
- [ ] Audit logging captures all command execution attempts

✅ **AC-1.2**: Core command tools implemented with @mesh_agent decorator integration
- [ ] `execute_command(command: str, timeout: int = 30) -> CommandResult` functional
- [ ] `get_process_status(pid: int) -> ProcessInfo` returns accurate process data
- [ ] `kill_process(pid: int) -> bool` safely terminates processes with proper checks
- [ ] All tools use @mesh_agent + @server.tool decorator pattern

✅ **AC-1.3**: Async execution with progress tracking operational
- [ ] Long-running commands execute asynchronously without blocking
- [ ] Progress tracking provides real-time updates during execution
- [ ] Timeout handling prevents runaway processes
- [ ] Cancellation mechanism allows stopping in-progress operations

## Security and Validation Criteria
✅ **AC-2.1**: Command validation and sanitization prevents security issues
- [ ] Input sanitization prevents command injection attacks
- [ ] Command whitelist blocks dangerous system operations
- [ ] Parameter validation ensures safe command construction
- [ ] Error messages don't leak sensitive system information

✅ **AC-2.2**: Permission checking and audit logging comprehensive
- [ ] Permission checks validate user authority for each command
- [ ] Audit log captures command, user, timestamp, and result
- [ ] Failed permission checks logged with sufficient detail
- [ ] Audit logs stored securely and tamper-resistant

## Developer Agent Implementation Criteria
✅ **AC-3.1**: Developer Agent with context management functional
- [ ] Context preservation maintains state across multiple operations
- [ ] Session management handles multiple concurrent development tasks
- [ ] Resource cleanup prevents memory leaks during long sessions
- [ ] Error recovery restores context after failures

✅ **AC-3.2**: Development tools implemented with @mesh_agent integration
- [ ] `analyze_code(file_path: str) -> CodeAnalysis` provides comprehensive analysis
- [ ] `run_tests(test_path: str) -> TestResults` executes and reports test results
- [ ] `format_code(file_path: str) -> bool` applies consistent code formatting
- [ ] `get_project_structure() -> ProjectTree` maps complete project hierarchy

✅ **AC-3.3**: Integration with common development tools successful
- [ ] Code analysis integrates with linters and static analysis tools
- [ ] Test execution supports multiple testing frameworks
- [ ] Code formatting respects project-specific configuration
- [ ] IDE integration enables seamless development workflow

## Integration and Testing Criteria
✅ **AC-4.1**: Comprehensive test suite validates both agents
- [ ] Unit tests cover all Command Agent security scenarios
- [ ] Integration tests validate Developer Agent context management
- [ ] Security tests confirm protection against malicious inputs
- [ ] Performance tests ensure acceptable response times

✅ **AC-4.2**: Async operations and progress reporting functional
- [ ] Async command execution doesn't block other operations
- [ ] Progress reporting provides meaningful status updates
- [ ] Error handling maintains system stability
- [ ] Resource cleanup prevents accumulation of zombie processes

## MCP Protocol Compliance Criteria
✅ **AC-5.1**: Both agents fully comply with MCP protocol standards
- [ ] Tool discovery returns complete capability information
- [ ] All tools accept and return properly formatted MCP messages
- [ ] Error responses follow MCP error specification
- [ ] Type annotations match MCP schema requirements

✅ **AC-5.2**: Security measures maintain MCP protocol integrity
- [ ] Authentication doesn't interfere with MCP message flow
- [ ] Security checks preserve MCP response format
- [ ] Error cases return valid MCP error responses
- [ ] Audit logging doesn't impact MCP performance

## Success Validation Criteria
✅ **AC-6.1**: End-to-end agent functionality demonstration
- [ ] Command Agent safely executes system operations through MCP
- [ ] Developer Agent successfully manages development workflows
- [ ] Both agents handle concurrent operations correctly
- [ ] Security measures prevent unauthorized access while maintaining usability

✅ **AC-6.2**: Context management and state preservation working
- [ ] Developer Agent maintains context across multiple MCP calls
- [ ] Command Agent tracks operation history for audit purposes
- [ ] State recovery works correctly after agent restart
- [ ] Memory usage remains stable during long-running sessions
