**Goal: An enterprise AI framework for maximum official MCP SDK compliance with minimum boiler plate code for users**

# Week 1, Day 2: Command and Developer Agents

## Primary Objectives
- Implement Command Agent for system operations using MCP SDK
- Create Developer Agent with context management capabilities
- Establish async operation support across all agents
- Implement comprehensive MCP protocol compliance testing

## MCP SDK Requirements
- Use FastMCP async operation patterns for long-running tasks
- Implement context management using MCP SDK built-in features
- Maintain type safety with strongly typed function signatures
- Follow MCP SDK authentication and security patterns

## Technical Requirements
- Command Agent with secure system operation capabilities
- Developer Agent with IDE integration and code analysis tools
- Async/await implementation for all agent operations
- Progress tracking for long-running operations using MCP SDK patterns

## Success Criteria
- Both agents fully functional with MCP protocol compliance
- Async operations working correctly with progress reporting
- Context management preserving state across operations
- Security measures preventing unauthorized system access
