# Week 4, Day 2: Helm Charts and K8s Manifests - Tasks

## Morning (4 hours)
### ConfigMaps and Immutable Configuration Management
**⚠️ CRITICAL: No hot-reload - configuration changes require container restart!**
- [ ] Create immutable configuration system integration:
  - Convert YAML configuration system to Kubernetes ConfigMaps
  - Container restart mechanism for configuration changes (no hot-reload)
  - Create environment-specific configuration overlays
  - Add configuration validation for MCP server settings at startup
- [ ] Develop container-based configuration management:
  - Configuration diff and merge tools for deployment pipeline
  - Environment promotion workflows via GitOps
  - Configuration versioning through container image tags
  - Integration with existing YAML configuration from Week 2

### Secrets Management Implementation
- [ ] Design secure secrets management strategy:
  - Kubernetes Secrets for enterprise authentication credentials
  - API key management and automatic rotation
  - Integration with external secret management (Vault, AWS Secrets Manager)
  - Secure MCP server credential handling
- [ ] Implement secrets automation:
  - Automatic secret generation for new deployments
  - Secret rotation workflows and monitoring
  - Integration with RBAC system from Week 3
  - Audit logging for secret access and changes

## Afternoon (4 hours)
### Service Definitions and Networking
- [ ] Create comprehensive service definitions:
  - Registry service with load balancing and service discovery
  - Agent services with proper MCP protocol port configuration
  - Dashboard service with external access requirements
  - Internal service mesh communication setup
- [ ] Implement network security and policies:
  - Network policies for service isolation and security
  - Ingress controller configuration for external access
  - Service mesh preparation (Istio/Linkerd compatibility)
  - Load balancer configuration for production traffic

### Production Optimization and Health Checks
- [ ] Configure production-ready resource management:
  - CPU and memory limits and requests optimization
  - Resource quotas and limit ranges for namespaces
  - Node affinity and anti-affinity rules
  - Horizontal Pod Autoscaler preparation
- [ ] Implement comprehensive health monitoring:
  - Liveness probes for all services including MCP agents
  - Readiness probes for startup and dependency validation
  - Startup probes for services with longer initialization
  - Graceful shutdown handling and termination grace periods
