**Goal: An enterprise AI framework for maximum official MCP SDK compliance with minimum boiler plate code for users**

# Week 4, Day 3: Monitoring and Auto-Scaling

## Primary Objectives
- Implement comprehensive monitoring infrastructure using Prometheus and Grafana
- Configure Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) for automatic scaling
- Establish service mesh integration for advanced traffic management
- Create operational dashboards for production monitoring

## MCP SDK Requirements
- Monitoring system must track MCP protocol performance metrics
- Auto-scaling respects MCP agent lifecycle and connection management
- Service mesh maintains MCP communication patterns and reliability
- Metrics collection preserves MCP SDK functionality and performance

## Technical Requirements

### Prometheus Monitoring Stack
- Prometheus server deployment with persistent storage
- Custom metrics for MCP framework components:
  - Registry service performance (request latency, throughput)
  - Agent health and availability metrics
  - MCP protocol connection and message metrics
  - Resource utilization across all services
- ServiceMonitor configurations for automatic target discovery
- AlertManager integration for proactive issue detection

### Grafana Dashboard Suite
- Operational dashboards for system overview and health
- Agent-specific dashboards showing MCP protocol metrics
- Registry service performance and capacity monitoring
- Infrastructure monitoring (CPU, memory, network, storage)
- Business metrics dashboards (agent usage, request patterns)

### Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)
- CPU-based autoscaling for all stateless services
- Memory-based autoscaling for memory-intensive agents
- Custom metrics autoscaling based on MCP protocol load
- Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA) configuration for right-sizing
- Cluster Autoscaler preparation for node-level scaling

### Service Mesh Integration
- Istio or Linkerd deployment and configuration
- Traffic management policies for MCP services
- Circuit breaker patterns for resilient agent communication
- Distributed tracing for request flow analysis
- mTLS for secure inter-service communication

## Performance Requirements
- Monitoring overhead: <5% CPU and memory impact
- Metrics collection: <100ms latency for real-time metrics
- Auto-scaling response time: <60 seconds for scale-up decisions
- Dashboard load time: <3 seconds for all operational views
- Service mesh latency: <10ms additional overhead

## Dependencies
- Helm charts and Kubernetes deployment from Day 1-2
- Registry service and agents from Weeks 1-3
- Security framework integration for monitoring authentication
- Production-ready configuration from previous days

## Success Criteria
- Complete monitoring stack deployed and collecting metrics
- Auto-scaling responding correctly to load changes
- Service mesh providing enhanced traffic management
- Operational dashboards available for production monitoring
- All monitoring preserving MCP protocol functionality
