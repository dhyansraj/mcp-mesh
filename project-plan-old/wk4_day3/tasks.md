# Week 4, Day 3: Monitoring and Auto-Scaling - Tasks

## Morning (4 hours)
### Prometheus Monitoring Stack Setup
- [ ] Deploy Prometheus monitoring infrastructure:
  - Install Prometheus operator using Helm chart
  - Configure persistent storage for metrics data
  - Set up Prometheus server with proper resource allocation
  - Configure retention policies for long-term storage
- [ ] Create custom metrics for MCP framework:
  - Registry service metrics (request rate, latency, errors)
  - Agent health and performance metrics
  - MCP protocol connection and message throughput
  - Resource utilization metrics (CPU, memory, network)
- [ ] Configure service discovery and monitoring:
  - ServiceMonitor configurations for automatic target discovery
  - PodMonitor for agent-specific metrics collection
  - Network monitoring for inter-service communication
  - Custom exporters for MCP-specific metrics

### Standard AlertManager Configuration
**⚠️ SIMPLIFIED: Use standard Prometheus AlertManager, not custom alerting system**
- [ ] Set up basic alerting system:
  - Standard AlertManager deployment with basic configuration
  - Essential alert rules for system health and performance
  - Basic notification channels (email, webhook)
  - Simple alert routing (no complex escalation policies)
- [ ] Define essential MCP-specific alert rules:
  - Agent availability and health alerts
  - Registry service performance degradation
  - MCP protocol connection issues
  - Resource exhaustion and capacity warnings
**⚠️ Note: Advanced alerting features (custom escalation, complex routing) will be added in future versions**

## Afternoon (4 hours)
### Grafana Dashboard Development
- [ ] Deploy Grafana with enterprise features:
  - Install Grafana using Helm chart with persistent storage
  - Configure authentication integration with RBAC system
  - Set up dashboard provisioning and version control
  - Configure data sources for Prometheus and other metrics
- [ ] Create comprehensive operational dashboards:
  - System overview dashboard with key performance indicators
  - Agent-specific dashboards showing MCP protocol metrics
  - Registry service performance and capacity monitoring
  - Infrastructure monitoring (nodes, pods, services)
  - Business metrics dashboard for usage analytics

### Auto-Scaling Implementation
- [ ] Configure Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA):
  - CPU-based autoscaling for registry and stateless agents
  - Memory-based autoscaling for memory-intensive services
  - Custom metrics autoscaling based on MCP message queue depth
  - Configure scaling policies and thresholds
- [ ] Implement advanced scaling strategies:
  - Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA) for optimal resource sizing
  - Predictive scaling based on historical patterns
  - Multi-metric scaling combining CPU, memory, and custom metrics
  - Cluster Autoscaler preparation for node-level scaling
