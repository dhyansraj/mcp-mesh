# Week 2, Day 2: Declarative Agent Wiring

## Primary Objectives
- Implement declarative agent wiring from YAML configurations
- Create automatic dependency resolution for agent networks
- Build agent lifecycle management based on configuration
- Establish configuration-driven MCP server orchestration

## MCP SDK Requirements
- Declarative wiring supporting MCP client-server relationships
- Automatic MCP connection management from configuration
- Agent dependency resolution maintaining MCP protocol compliance
- Configuration-driven FastMCP server initialization and teardown

## Technical Requirements
- Agent dependency graph construction and validation
- Automatic MCP client connection establishment
- Configuration-driven agent startup sequencing
- Dynamic agent wiring updates without full system restart
- Dependency injection for MCP tools and resources

## Success Criteria
- Agent networks successfully created from YAML configuration
- Dependency resolution handles complex agent relationships
- MCP connections established automatically per configuration
- Agent lifecycle properly managed through configuration changes
