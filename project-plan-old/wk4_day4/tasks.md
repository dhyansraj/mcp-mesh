# Week 4, Day 4: Service Mesh Integration and Advanced Monitoring - Tasks

## Morning (4 hours)
### Service Mesh Advanced Configuration
- [ ] Deploy and configure service mesh (Istio/Linkerd):
  - Install service mesh control plane with production settings
  - Configure mesh policies for MCP protocol traffic
  - Set up automatic sidecar injection for MCP services
  - Configure mesh networking and security policies
- [ ] Implement advanced traffic management:
  - Traffic splitting for canary deployments
  - Fault injection policies for resilience testing
  - Rate limiting and circuit breaker configuration
  - Load balancing optimization for MCP protocol patterns
- [ ] Configure security and mTLS:
  - Mutual TLS enablement for all inter-service communication
  - Authorization policies for MCP service access
  - Service-to-service authentication and encryption
  - Integration with RBAC system from Week 3

### Distributed Tracing Implementation
- [ ] Deploy distributed tracing infrastructure:
  - Install Jaeger or Zipkin with persistent storage
  - Configure OpenTelemetry collector for trace aggregation
  - Set up trace sampling strategies for production performance
  - Configure trace retention and storage policies
- [ ] Instrument MCP framework for tracing:
  - Add OpenTelemetry instrumentation to registry service
  - Instrument MCP agents for protocol message tracing
  - Create custom spans for business logic operations
  - Configure trace context propagation across services

## Afternoon (4 hours)
### Basic Metrics and Simple Analytics
**⚠️ SIMPLIFIED: Focus on essential metrics, not advanced business intelligence**
- [ ] Implement essential operational metrics:
  - Basic agent usage and performance metrics
  - MCP protocol message throughput and latency
  - System utilization and health metrics
  - Simple resource optimization tracking
- [ ] Create standard operational dashboards:
  - System health dashboard with key metrics
  - Agent performance dashboard with basic insights
  - Resource utilization dashboard for capacity planning
  - Simple cost tracking dashboard
**⚠️ Note: Advanced analytics (BI, ML-based insights, complex reporting) will be added in future versions**

### Auto-Scaling Optimization
- [ ] Optimize auto-scaling policies:
  - Fine-tune HPA policies based on production patterns
  - Implement predictive scaling using historical data
  - Configure custom metrics controllers for MCP-specific scaling
  - Optimize VPA settings for right-sizing resources
- [ ] Implement cluster-level scaling:
  - Configure Cluster Autoscaler for node management
  - Set up node pool optimization strategies
  - Implement cost-aware scaling policies
  - Configure scaling policies for different workload types
