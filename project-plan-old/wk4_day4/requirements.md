# Week 4, Day 4: Service Mesh Integration and Advanced Monitoring

## Primary Objectives
- Complete service mesh integration for advanced traffic management
- Implement distributed tracing and observability
- Enhance monitoring with business metrics and analytics
- Optimize auto-scaling policies based on production patterns

## MCP SDK Requirements
- Service mesh must preserve MCP protocol semantics and performance
- Distributed tracing captures MCP message flow without interference
- Business metrics align with MCP SDK usage patterns and capabilities
- Auto-scaling optimization maintains MCP agent connection stability

## Technical Requirements

### Service Mesh Advanced Features
- Traffic splitting and canary deployment capabilities
- Fault injection for chaos engineering and testing
- Rate limiting and circuit breaker implementation
- Load balancing optimized for MCP protocol characteristics
- Security policies with mTLS and authorization

### Distributed Tracing Implementation
- Jaeger or Zipkin deployment for trace collection
- OpenTelemetry instrumentation for MCP protocol traces
- Trace sampling strategies for production performance
- Correlation between traces, metrics, and logs
- Performance impact analysis and optimization

### Business Metrics and Analytics
- Agent usage patterns and performance analytics
- MCP protocol message analysis and optimization
- User behavior tracking and system utilization
- Cost analysis and resource optimization metrics
- Capacity planning and growth projection data

### Auto-Scaling Optimization
- Advanced HPA policies with multiple metrics
- Predictive scaling based on historical patterns
- Custom metrics controllers for MCP-specific scaling
- Resource optimization through VPA integration
- Cluster-level scaling policies and node management

## Performance Requirements
- Service mesh latency overhead: <5ms for MCP protocol messages
- Distributed tracing sampling: <1% performance impact
- Business metrics collection: Real-time with <10s lag
- Auto-scaling response: <30s for urgent scale-up scenarios
- Overall system performance: <2% degradation from monitoring

## Integration Requirements
- Seamless integration with existing Prometheus/Grafana stack
- Compatibility with Kubernetes RBAC and security policies
- Integration with CI/CD pipelines for deployment monitoring
- External systems integration (logging, alerting, analytics)

## Dependencies
- Completed monitoring stack from Day 3
- Service mesh preparation from Day 3
- Helm charts and deployment infrastructure
- Security framework for service mesh policies

## Success Criteria
- Service mesh providing advanced traffic management
- Distributed tracing operational across all services
- Business metrics enabling data-driven optimization
- Auto-scaling optimized for production workloads
- Complete observability stack ready for production
