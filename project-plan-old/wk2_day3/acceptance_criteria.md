# Week 2, Day 3: Dynamic Configuration Management - Acceptance Criteria

## Developer Rules Compliance
- [ ] **MCP SDK First**: All configuration management features use official MCP SDK patterns without bypassing core functionality
- [ ] **Package Architecture**: Configuration interfaces in `mcp-mesh-types`, implementations in `mcp-mesh`, examples import from types only
- [ ] **MCP Compatibility**: Configuration system works in vanilla MCP environment with types package, enhanced features activate with full package
- [ ] **Community Ready**: Examples demonstrate proper MCP SDK patterns first, mesh features as optional enhancements

## Container-Based Configuration System
✅ **AC-2.3.1** Container configuration management implemented without hot-reload
- [ ] Docker multi-stage builds configured for environment-specific configs
- [ ] ConfigMap and Secret integration operational for Kubernetes deployments
- [ ] Environment variable substitution and validation working correctly
- [ ] Build-time template processing pipeline functional
- [ ] Configuration changes trigger container restart mechanisms (no file watching)

✅ **AC-2.3.2** Configuration validation system prevents invalid deployments
- [ ] JSON Schema validation implemented for all configuration files
- [ ] Environment variable validation with proper type checking
- [ ] Configuration dependency validation catches circular dependencies
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline integration validates configs before deployment

## Pull-Based Architecture Implementation
✅ **AC-2.3.3** Pull-based capability injection system respects architectural constraints
- [ ] Agent polling mechanism implemented for capability updates (no push from registry)
- [ ] Registry responds with new capabilities during agent heartbeat requests
- [ ] Local capability caching implemented on agent side for performance
- [ ] Graceful capability updates during agent polling cycles
- [ ] No WebSocket or push-based communication used anywhere in system

✅ **AC-2.3.4** Configuration distribution follows pull-based patterns
- [ ] Configuration updates delivered via registry polling responses only
- [ ] Agent-side configuration caching and versioning implemented
- [ ] Container restart triggers implemented for major config changes
- [ ] Configuration consistency validation across agents functional

## Configuration Versioning and Management
✅ **AC-2.3.5** Git-based configuration versioning enables reliable rollbacks
- [ ] Version tracking through Git commits and tags implemented
- [ ] Configuration change history and audit trail available
- [ ] Rollback mechanism via container image versioning functional
- [ ] Branch-based environment configuration working correctly

✅ **AC-2.3.6** Deployment pipeline integration automates configuration lifecycle
- [ ] Automated configuration builds triggered on Git changes
- [ ] Container image versioning aligned with config versions
- [ ] Environment promotion workflows operational
- [ ] Configuration validation prevents deployment of invalid configs

## MCP SDK Integration
✅ **AC-2.3.7** Dynamic configuration preserves MCP protocol compliance
- [ ] MCP server reconfiguration maintains active connections
- [ ] Runtime capability injection follows MCP tool registration patterns
- [ ] Configuration updates preserve MCP protocol compliance
- [ ] Live configuration synchronization works across MCP agent networks

✅ **AC-2.3.8** Configuration system integrates with existing MCP tools
- [ ] Configuration management tools properly registered with @server.tool decorator
- [ ] update_agent_capabilities() function operational via MCP protocol
- [ ] get_available_capabilities() provides real-time capability status
- [ ] validate_capability_dependencies() prevents invalid capability injection

## Performance and Reliability
✅ **AC-2.3.9** Configuration system meets performance requirements
- [ ] Configuration polling adds <5% overhead to agent operations
- [ ] Configuration caching reduces network calls by >80%
- [ ] Container restart completes within 30 seconds for config changes
- [ ] Configuration validation completes within 10 seconds for standard configs

✅ **AC-2.3.10** System reliability under configuration changes
- [ ] Configuration distribution works during partial network failures
- [ ] Agent configuration health monitoring detects drift and inconsistencies
- [ ] Configuration version tracking per agent prevents version conflicts
- [ ] Configuration rollback completes within 60 seconds

## Testing and Validation
✅ **AC-2.3.11** Comprehensive testing validates configuration functionality
- [ ] Unit tests cover all configuration management operations
- [ ] Integration tests validate pull-based capability injection
- [ ] End-to-end tests confirm configuration synchronization across agents
- [ ] Performance tests validate system behavior under configuration load

✅ **AC-2.3.12** Configuration system handles edge cases gracefully
- [ ] Invalid configuration changes rejected with clear error messages
- [ ] Configuration conflicts resolved with proper precedence rules
- [ ] Agent startup succeeds with missing or invalid configuration
- [ ] Configuration system recovers from temporary registry unavailability

## Success Validation Criteria
- [ ] **Complete System Integration**: Configuration management fully integrated with registry service and agent framework
- [ ] **Pull-Based Architecture**: All configuration distribution follows pull patterns with no push communication
- [ ] **Container Restart Model**: Configuration changes properly trigger container restarts without hot-reload
- [ ] **Production Readiness**: Configuration system ready for Kubernetes deployment with proper monitoring
- [ ] **MCP SDK Compliance**: All configuration features maintain full MCP protocol compatibility
