**Goal: An enterprise AI framework for maximum official MCP SDK compliance with minimum boiler plate code for users**

# Week 2, Day 3: Dynamic Configuration Management

## Primary Objectives
- Implement runtime configuration updates without service interruption
- Create capability injection system for dynamic agent enhancement
- Build configuration versioning and rollback mechanisms
- Establish real-time configuration synchronization across agent networks

## MCP SDK Requirements
- Dynamic MCP server reconfiguration while maintaining connections
- Runtime capability injection following MCP tool patterns
- Configuration updates preserving MCP protocol compliance
- Live configuration synchronization across MCP agent networks

## Technical Requirements
- Configuration hot-reloading with change detection
- Runtime capability injection and tool registration
- Configuration versioning with rollback support
- Distributed configuration synchronization
- Configuration change notification and event system

## Success Criteria
- Configuration changes applied without service downtime
- Capability injection works seamlessly during runtime
- Configuration versioning enables reliable rollbacks
- Multi-agent networks stay synchronized during configuration updates
