# Week 2, Day 3: Container-Based Configuration Management - Tasks

## Morning (4 hours)
### Container Configuration System
- [ ] Implement container-based configuration management:
  - Docker multi-stage builds for environment-specific configs
  - ConfigMap and Secret integration for Kubernetes
  - Environment variable substitution and validation
  - Build-time template processing pipeline
- [ ] Create configuration validation system:
  - JSON Schema validation for all configuration files
  - Environment variable validation and type checking
  - Configuration dependency validation
  - CI/CD pipeline integration for config validation

### Configuration Versioning
- [ ] Implement Git-based configuration versioning:
  - Version tracking through Git commits and tags
  - Configuration change history and audit trail
  - Rollback via container image versioning
  - Branch-based environment configuration
- [ ] Add deployment pipeline integration:
  - Automated configuration builds on Git changes
  - Container image versioning aligned with config versions
  - Environment promotion workflows

## Afternoon (4 hours)
### Pull-Based Capability Injection
**⚠️ CRITICAL: Registry uses PULL-based architecture - agents call registry, not push!**
- [ ] Create pull-based capability injection system:
  - Agent polling mechanism for capability updates
  - Registry responds with new capabilities during heartbeat
  - Local capability caching on agent side
  - Graceful capability updates during agent polling
- [ ] Implement injection management tools:
  - update_agent_capabilities(agent_id: str, capabilities: List[Capability]) -> bool
  - get_available_capabilities(agent_id: str) -> List[Capability]
  - validate_capability_dependencies(capability: Capability) -> ValidationResult

### Configuration Distribution
**⚠️ CRITICAL: No file watching - use container restart for config changes!**
- [ ] Build pull-based configuration distribution:
  - Configuration updates via registry polling responses
  - Agent-side configuration caching and versioning
  - Container restart triggers for major config changes
  - Configuration consistency validation across agents
- [ ] Create distribution monitoring:
  - Configuration version tracking per agent
  - Configuration drift detection and reporting
  - Agent configuration health monitoring
