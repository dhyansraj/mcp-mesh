**Goal: An enterprise AI framework for maximum official MCP SDK compliance with minimum boiler plate code for users**

# Week 5, Day 2: CLI Enhancement and Development Tools

## Primary Objectives
- Enhance CLI tools with advanced debugging and monitoring capabilities
- Implement comprehensive logging and troubleshooting utilities
- Create development testing framework with MCP protocol validation
- Establish CI/CD integration tools for automated workflows

## MCP SDK Requirements
- Debugging tools must provide insight into MCP protocol message flow
- Testing framework validates MCP SDK compliance automatically
- Monitoring utilities track MCP agent performance and health
- CI/CD tools maintain MCP protocol compatibility through deployment pipeline

## Technical Requirements

### Advanced CLI Features
- Real-time system monitoring and status commands
- Comprehensive logging aggregation and filtering
- Advanced debugging utilities for MCP protocol troubleshooting
- Performance profiling and optimization tools
- System health checks and diagnostic commands

### Debugging and Troubleshooting Tools
- MCP protocol message inspection and debugging
- Agent lifecycle monitoring and troubleshooting
- Network connectivity and service mesh debugging
- Resource utilization and performance analysis
- Configuration validation and error diagnosis

### Development Testing Framework
- Automated MCP protocol compliance testing
- Integration testing for agent interactions
- Load testing utilities for development validation
- Mock services and test data generation
- Continuous testing and validation workflows

### CI/CD Integration Tools
- GitHub Actions / GitLab CI pipeline templates
- Automated testing and validation in CI/CD
- Deployment pipeline with staging and production promotion
- Configuration management and environment promotion
- Security scanning and compliance validation

## Extended CLI Commands
```bash
mcp-mesh status --detailed              # Comprehensive system status
mcp-mesh logs --follow --agent=<name>   # Real-time log streaming
mcp-mesh debug protocol <agent>         # MCP protocol debugging
mcp-mesh debug network                  # Network connectivity testing
mcp-mesh test mcp-compliance            # MCP protocol compliance testing
mcp-mesh test load --agents=100         # Local load testing
mcp-mesh profile agent <name>           # Performance profiling
mcp-mesh health check                   # System health diagnostics
mcp-mesh ci generate                    # Generate CI/CD pipeline
mcp-mesh ci validate                    # Validate CI/CD configuration
```

## Performance Requirements
- CLI response time: <2 seconds for status and monitoring commands
- Log aggregation: Real-time streaming with <1 second delay
- Testing framework: Complete test suite execution in <5 minutes
- Debugging tools: Interactive debugging with minimal performance impact

## Dependencies
- CLI foundation from Day 1
- Monitoring infrastructure from Week 4
- Agent implementations and registry service
- Production deployment capabilities

## Success Criteria
- Enhanced CLI providing comprehensive development and debugging capabilities
- Testing framework ensuring MCP protocol compliance
- Troubleshooting tools enabling rapid issue resolution
- CI/CD integration streamlining automated workflows
- Complete developer toolkit supporting full development lifecycle
