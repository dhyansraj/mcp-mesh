# Week 3, Day 2: Advanced RBAC and Permission Management - Acceptance Criteria

## Developer Rules Compliance
- [ ] **MCP SDK First**: Advanced RBAC features use official MCP SDK patterns for fine-grained access control without bypassing core functionality
- [ ] **Package Architecture**: Advanced permission interfaces in `mcp-mesh-types`, implementations in `mcp-mesh`, examples import from types only
- [ ] **MCP Compatibility**: Advanced RBAC works in vanilla MCP environment with types package, enhanced features activate with full package
- [ ] **Community Ready**: Advanced RBAC examples demonstrate proper MCP SDK patterns first, mesh features as optional enhancements

## Fine-Grained Permission Model
✅ **AC-3.2.1** Granular permission system controls specific agent operations
- [ ] Resource-specific permissions (agent:read, tool:execute, config:modify) implemented
- [ ] Operation-level access controls for individual MCP tools functional
- [ ] Conditional permissions based on context (time, location, resource state)
- [ ] Permission scoping by agent, tool, or resource type enables precise control

✅ **AC-3.2.2** Permission management system supports enterprise complexity
- [ ] Dynamic permission evaluation during runtime without performance impact
- [ ] Permission inheritance and override mechanisms handle complex hierarchies
- [ ] Bulk permission operations enable efficient role management
- [ ] Permission template system provides common patterns for reuse

## Permission Delegation Framework
✅ **AC-3.2.3** Delegation framework enables secure temporary access
- [ ] Temporary permission delegation with automatic expiration implemented
- [ ] Approval workflow for permission requests with proper authorization chains
- [ ] Delegation audit trail maintains accountability and compliance
- [ ] Emergency access procedures with enhanced logging and monitoring

✅ **AC-3.2.4** Delegation MCP tools provide programmatic delegation management
- [ ] delegate_permission() function properly registered with @server.tool decorator
- [ ] approve_delegation() supports workflow-based permission approval
- [ ] revoke_delegation() provides immediate delegation termination with audit trail
- [ ] Delegation tools maintain MCP SDK compliance and functionality

## Audit and Compliance System
✅ **AC-3.2.5** Comprehensive audit system provides complete security operation history
- [ ] Security event logging captures all authentication and authorization events
- [ ] Permission change tracking with before/after states for compliance
- [ ] Access attempt logging (successful and failed) for security monitoring
- [ ] Compliance reporting supports security audits and regulatory requirements

✅ **AC-3.2.6** Audit management tools enable security operation oversight

- [ ] Audit tools registered with @server.tool for MCP protocol access

## Dashboard Integration
✅ **AC-3.2.7** RBAC dashboard integration provides comprehensive user interface
- [ ] User and role management interface with intuitive operation workflows
- [ ] Permission assignment and delegation UI with visual permission matrix
- [ ] Audit log viewer with advanced search and filtering capabilities
- [ ] Real-time security monitoring dashboard with alert notifications

✅ **AC-3.2.8** Security management features enhance operational visibility
- [ ] Role-based dashboard access controls restrict sensitive operations
- [ ] Permission matrix visualization shows complex permission relationships
- [ ] Security alert notifications provide real-time threat awareness
- [ ] User activity monitoring tracks behavior patterns and anomalies

## MCP SDK Integration and Performance
✅ **AC-3.2.9** Fine-grained permissions integrate with MCP protocol operations
- [ ] Individual MCP tool access controlled by granular permissions
- [ ] Permission filtering of MCP capabilities based on user roles
- [ ] Temporary access controls work with MCP session management
- [ ] Audit logging captures all MCP security operations without performance impact

✅ **AC-3.2.10** Advanced RBAC maintains MCP SDK functionality and performance
- [ ] Permission evaluation adds <10ms latency to MCP tool execution
- [ ] Delegation operations complete within 5 seconds for standard workflows
- [ ] Audit logging operates asynchronously without blocking MCP operations
- [ ] Complex permission hierarchies resolved within 100ms

## Permission Template and Pattern System
✅ **AC-3.2.11** Permission templates simplify common access patterns
- [ ] Role-based templates for standard user types (admin, operator, viewer)
- [ ] Agent-specific permission templates for different agent categories
- [ ] Project-based permission templates for multi-tenant environments
- [ ] Custom permission patterns support specialized enterprise requirements

✅ **AC-3.2.12** Template system integrates with permission management workflow
- [ ] Template application preserves existing custom permissions
- [ ] Template inheritance enables progressive permission refinement
- [ ] Template validation prevents security policy violations
- [ ] Template versioning supports permission policy evolution

## Security and Compliance
✅ **AC-3.2.13** Advanced RBAC meets enterprise security standards
- [ ] Principle of least privilege enforced throughout permission system
- [ ] Separation of duties supported through role combination restrictions
- [ ] Permission conflicts detected and resolved with clear precedence rules
- [ ] Security policy compliance validated during permission assignment

✅ **AC-3.2.14** Audit and compliance capabilities support regulatory requirements
- [ ] Comprehensive audit trail supports SOX, GDPR, and HIPAA compliance
- [ ] Tamper-evident audit logging prevents log manipulation
- [ ] Audit data retention policies support legal and regulatory requirements
- [ ] Compliance reporting provides evidence for security audits

## Integration and Scalability
✅ **AC-3.2.15** Advanced RBAC integrates with existing framework components
- [ ] Registry Service integration supports agent-level fine-grained access controls
- [ ] Configuration system integration enables permission-based configuration access
- [ ] Dashboard integration provides comprehensive security management interface
- [ ] Monitoring system integration tracks security events and performance metrics
