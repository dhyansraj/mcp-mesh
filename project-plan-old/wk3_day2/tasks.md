# Week 3, Day 2: Advanced RBAC and Permission Management - Tasks

## Morning (4 hours)
### Fine-Grained Permissions
- [ ] Implement granular permission model:
  - Resource-specific permissions (agent:read, tool:execute, config:modify)
  - Operation-level access controls for MCP tools
  - Conditional permissions based on context
  - Permission scoping by agent, tool, or resource type
- [ ] Create permission management system:
  - Dynamic permission evaluation during runtime
  - Permission inheritance and override mechanisms
  - Bulk permission operations for role management
  - Permission template system for common patterns

### Permission Delegation
- [ ] Build delegation framework:
  - Temporary permission delegation with expiration
  - Approval workflow for permission requests
  - Delegation audit trail and accountability
  - Emergency access procedures with proper logging
- [ ] Implement delegation MCP tools:
  - delegate_permission(from_user: str, to_user: str, permission: str, duration: int) -> DelegationResult
  - approve_delegation(delegation_id: str, approver: str) -> ApprovalResult
  - revoke_delegation(delegation_id: str, reason: str) -> RevocationResult

## Afternoon (4 hours)
### Audit and Compliance
- [ ] Implement comprehensive audit system:
  - Security event logging for all authentication/authorization
  - Permission change tracking with before/after states
  - Access attempt logging (successful and failed)
  - Compliance reporting for security audits
- [ ] Create audit management tools:
  - query_audit_log(filters: AuditFilters) -> List[AuditEvent]
  - generate_compliance_report(period: DateRange) -> ComplianceReport
  - export_audit_data(format: ExportFormat) -> ExportResult

### Dashboard Integration
- [ ] Integrate RBAC with dashboard:
  - User and role management interface
  - Permission assignment and delegation UI
  - Audit log viewer with search and filtering
  - Real-time security monitoring dashboard
- [ ] Add security management features:
  - Role-based dashboard access controls
  - Permission matrix visualization
  - Security alert notifications
  - User activity monitoring
