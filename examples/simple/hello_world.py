MCP Mesh Hello World Example with FastMCP Integration

This example demonstrates the hybrid FastMCP + MCP Mesh approach:
1. FastMCP decorators (@app.tool) for familiar MCP development
2. MCP Mesh decorators (@mesh.tool) for dependency injection and orchestration
3. Hybrid typing support for development flexibility
4. Pure simplicity - just dual decorators, no manual setup!

Start this agent, then start system_agent.py to see dependency injection in action!
