# MCP Mesh Types

Core types and interfaces for MCP Mesh - a lightweight package providing basic types and decorators for MCP SDK compatibility.

This package provides:

- No-op `@mesh_agent` decorator for basic MCP SDK compatibility
- Abstract FileOperations class with basic implementations
- Exception classes for file operations
- Zero dependencies except MCP

For full mesh capabilities, install the `mcp-mesh` package which extends these types.
