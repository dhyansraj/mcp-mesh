# AioHTTP Session Cleanup Fixes

## Problem Statement

When running MCP Mesh agents, the following errors appeared in the logs:

```
ERROR    Unclosed client session
         client_session: <aiohttp.client.ClientSession object at 0xe5663ca1ec60>
ERROR    Unclosed connector
         connections: ['deque([(<aiohttp.client_proto.ResponseHandler object at 0xe5663b62ec90>, 180259.378920329)])']
         connector: <aiohttp.connector.TCPConnector object at 0xe5663ac94dd0>
```

These errors indicate that aiohttp ClientSession objects were being created but not properly closed, leading to resource leaks.

## Root Causes

1. **Multiple Registry Clients**: Each `@mesh_agent` decorator was creating its own `RegistryClient` instance, and each client created its own aiohttp session.

2. **Auto-registration Cleanup**: The `DecoratorProcessor` used during auto-registration at module import time was creating a registry client but not closing it.

3. **No Session Sharing**: Multiple decorators in the same file would each create their own registry client and session, even though they were connecting to the same registry URL.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Registry Client Pool (`registry_client_pool.py`)

Created a singleton pool that manages registry clients:

```python
class RegistryClientPool:
    """Manages a pool of registry clients to avoid duplicates."""

    async def get_client(self, url: str, ...) -> RegistryClient:
        """Get or create a registry client for the given URL."""
        # Returns existing client if available, creates new one if not

    async def close_all(self) -> None:
        """Close all registry clients in the pool."""
        # Properly closes all sessions during shutdown
```

Benefits:

- Reuses registry clients for the same URL
- Centralized cleanup of all sessions
- Uses weak references to allow garbage collection
- Integrates with graceful shutdown system

### 2. Updated Mesh Decorator

Modified the mesh decorator to use the client pool:

```python
# Before
self._registry_client = RegistryClient(url=self.registry_url, ...)

# After
self._registry_client = await get_registry_client(url=self.registry_url, ...)
```

The decorator's cleanup method no longer closes the registry client directly, as it's managed by the pool.

### 3. Fixed Auto-registration Cleanup

Updated the decorator processor to properly close its registry client:

```python
processor = DecoratorProcessor(registry_url)
try:
    results = await processor.process_all_decorators()
    # ... process results ...
finally:
    # Always clean up the processor to close the registry client
    await processor.cleanup()
```

### 4. Added Cleanup Method to DecoratorProcessor

Added a cleanup method to ensure the registry client is closed:

```python
async def cleanup(self) -> None:
    """Clean up resources, especially the registry client."""
    if self.registry_client:
        try:
            await self.registry_client.close()
            self.logger.debug("Registry client closed successfully")
        except Exception as e:
            self.logger.error(f"Error closing registry client: {e}")
```

## Testing

The fixes have been tested with:

1. Multiple `@mesh_agent` decorators in the same file
2. Auto-registration during module import
3. Long-running agents with health monitoring
4. Graceful shutdown scenarios

No more "Unclosed client session" errors appear in the logs.

## Best Practices

1. **Always use context managers** when creating aiohttp sessions for one-off requests:

   ```python
   async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
       async with session.get(url) as response:
           # Process response
   ```

2. **Use the registry client pool** for any new code that needs to communicate with the registry:

   ```python
   from mcp_mesh_runtime.shared.registry_client_pool import get_registry_client

   client = await get_registry_client(registry_url)
   # Use client - no need to close, pool handles it
   ```

3. **Implement cleanup methods** for any class that creates long-lived resources like HTTP sessions.

4. **Register cleanup with graceful shutdown** to ensure resources are cleaned up during process termination.
