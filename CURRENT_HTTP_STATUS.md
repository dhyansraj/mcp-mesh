# Current HTTP Wrapper Status

## Summary

The HTTP wrapper feature exists but is not fully integrated with the current runtime setup.

## What's Implemented

1. **HTTP Wrapper Class** ✅

   - `HttpMcpWrapper` in `packages/mcp_mesh_runtime/src/mcp_mesh_runtime/server/http_wrapper.py`
   - Creates FastAPI servers with health checks
   - Auto-assigns ports
   - Mounts MCP server at `/mcp` endpoint

2. **Decorator Support** ✅

   - `@mesh_agent` decorator has `enable_http`, `http_host`, and `http_port` parameters
   - Initialization code exists in `_initialize_http_wrapper()` method

3. **Tests** ✅
   - Integration tests show the feature works when properly initialized

## What's Not Working

1. **Runtime Enhancement** ❌

   - `mcp_mesh_runtime` is not being auto-imported by `mcp-mesh-dev`
   - Without the runtime, HTTP features are not available

2. **Event Loop Management** ❌

   - The background thread that initializes the HTTP wrapper closes its event loop immediately
   - This prevents the HTTP server from staying running

3. **Auto-Detection** ❌
   - Environment variable `MCP_MESH_HTTP_ENABLED` is not checked
   - Kubernetes detection is not implemented

## Current Workarounds

### Option 1: Use stdio transport (Currently Working)

Your current setup works perfectly for MCP clients:

- Use MCP Inspector: `npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector`
- Configure Claude Desktop to use your servers
- Dependency injection is working correctly

### Option 2: Fix Would Require

1. Modify `mcp-mesh-dev` to ensure `mcp_mesh_runtime` is imported
2. Fix the event loop management in the background initialization thread
3. Implement environment variable detection for `enable_http`

## Why This Happened

The HTTP wrapper was implemented as part of Task 16 but the integration with the decorator's background initialization wasn't fully completed. The feature works in tests (where initialization is done manually) but not in production use where the decorator auto-initializes in a background thread.

## Recommendation

For now, continue using stdio transport which works perfectly for your use case. The HTTP wrapper would be useful for containerized deployments but requires additional work to integrate properly with the current initialization flow.
