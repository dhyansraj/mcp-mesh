Key commands: `meshctl start` (run agent), `meshctl list` (list running agents), `meshctl call` (invoke tool on agent), `meshctl scaffold` (generate agent from template/LLM), `meshctl status` (service status), `meshctl man` (manual pages). Core concepts: Registry (central coordination, stores capabilities, resolves dependencies), Agents (Python services with @mesh.agent decorator), Capabilities (named services agents provide), Dependencies (auto-injected at runtime). Agents communicate directly via MCP - registry facilitates discovery but never proxies calls. Uses dual-heartbeat system (HEAD every ~5s, POST on topology change).",
